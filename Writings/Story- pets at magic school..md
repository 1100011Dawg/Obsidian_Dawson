The tight quarters in front of the headmaster's room hug seemed to hug me tighter as the minute hand *Tic* *Tic* *Ticced*. The old oak door creaked open as a piercing voice shoot through, "Mr.Humphrey you may see the headmaster concerning your recent activity." The wry lady let me through and left it to the two of us.

"Edward your pet was a bit of an anomaly when you specialized in familiars but was allowed, but I am starting to regret that decision." said the archmage in a deep graveling voice.

"How was I supposed to know that we were supposed to summon an infernal or hatch one of those 'Fancy' Magic eggs"

"Please do not disrespect your fellow classmates chosen pets, Though we should have informed you beforehand considering your muggle origin. I hoped that would bide enough time for you to drop out."

"YOU WANTED ME TO DROP OUT?"

"I shouldn't of distracted from the subject at hand, that being your loose corgi and your many irresponsible alterations to him."

A blur of fur flew by, and it seemed as though my corgi had apparated right beside me, carrying a few fancy sticks.

He voiced in a controlled rage, "your magical corgi has singlehandedly disarmed the staff and students at this fine institution. Some of our staff members are the highest archmages in the world, yet they were all bested by this household pet." His eyes grew wide as he stared at my Corgi's collection. He now was fully screeching his words, "Now your irresponsibility is putting the entire wizarding world at risk due to his apparent access to the vaults. This will not go----"

My corgi started floating into the air and opened its mouth," He shall go unpunished since he has served me well. I have gained vast power and sapience from the magics in your vault and I shall seek patronage among new followers. For the steep cost of a belly rub a day I shall grant them ungodly powers. You, Edward, will be first among these for granting the boon of speed to my stubby legs, a power I fully used due to my lacking innate magic. Come forth and ascend above these mortals"

I then took my first step to endless power.
