Come forth from silent night
into a world of dreaming
Walk too and fro throughout the stars
feet pressing against the tides of sands
Come forth into a world of dreaming

Forget the monotone day
see colors in the sky
Let your mind drift away
into pleasant surprise

Let endless day shift into
Endless night
Let yourself be consumed by
a world of dreaming
