 - So simulate a very long rectangule and take out any area that touches the edges.
 - Find the equation that reults in the maximal area, with the independent varible being how far the point in space moves along the wall. This point is the mid point in space when the rectagle is fully pressed up to the edge . It will rouphy be a tringale
 - Think of the walls as squares? find out how to calculare rectangule are overlapping with swuare, also need to use claculus to see the difrence between are overlapping between time steps to see if minused

 - need to figure out how to acount going over the same area gain and again.
