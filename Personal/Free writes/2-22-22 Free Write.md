The prolitarate feel dienfrachised by todays society, and thus to revoke this ratchking like trend a new system of economics should be put into place. Though this system of economics need not significantly diffrer from out own; the fruits of our own ssytem is clear adn the benefiets of others due not seem to reap the harvest of our own. Though the rottenis in our harvest stems from the inequality present between the haves and the have nots. Though an economist says that inequality is correlated with wellbeing, this train of thorught might lead to the unjust paradgim that inequality casues this well being. To conteract this current condition I suggest the following systematic imporvements: 
 - An Implementation of Geoergism based upon a 80% land value tax
 - A change of our voting system to one that nears the VSE of STAR
 - Thridly a unregulatted prediction market.
 These changes will chip away at the wicked problems that stem from ur current capatalist system
