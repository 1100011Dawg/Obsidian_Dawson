# To skin a Cat
One needs three things, a cat, a knife and patience. A brownish color is most approrite though any color would due. The benefits are obvious, a whitish flet would be marred by blood to such an extant that it perterbes the mind, A blackish color, though spiriturally significant, will mar the sould with bad look. From this, the humble common felt is best. 


#### Down by the river
down by the river where my old man drowned, I hear his screams though they make no sound, down by the river where my first kiss lay, down by the river where I shall stay
