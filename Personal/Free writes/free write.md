# To skin a Cat
One needs three things, a cat, a knife and patience. A brownish color is most approrite though any color would due. The benefits are obvious, a whitish flet would be marred by blood to such an extant that it perterbes the mind, A blackish color, though spiriturally significant, will mar the sould with bad look. From this, the humble common felt is best.
