 - Details: I looked upon the Nile and raised the [pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_race_controversy) above it. Going back to the civil the quetion of who buil the pyramids was pretentios, with schoolars arguing that the caucation race was the ones to do it. With a contention of the black hypothsis otherwise. It seems that there was a significant population of Blcks, but the main race/ethnicity is the one that remains their today. Though the general consisnses is tha it was diverse, and black/white isn´t a good definition. Also what is supernegroed[^1]

[^1]:Sonia Zakrzewski (2003) studied skeletal samples from the Badarian period to the Middle Kingdom in Upper Egypt. The raw data suggested that the Ancient Egyptians in general had "tropical body plans" but that their proportions were actually "super-negroid", i.e. the limb indices are relatively longer than in many “African” populations. She proposed that the apparent development of an increasingly African body plan over time may also be due to Nubian mercenaries being included in the sample, especially in the Middle Kingdom sample. Zakrzewski concluded that the "results must remain provisional due to the relatively small sample sizes and the lack of skeletal material that cross-cuts all social and economic groups within each time period."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_race_controversy#cite_note-Zakrzewski2003-35)
