 - We transfer our heat energy into the water that evaperates from our skin. The water takes up a lot of heat energy to evaporate. My guess is slat is exported to maintain equilibrium. Heat of vaporization(important)
 - Sobrances that are soluble in water and can be transported by blood plasma. proteins ammino acids, vitamins (such as c, Riboflavin,Thiamin,Niacin,Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12)

 - **Catalase** is a proteint that converts $H_2O_2$(hydrogen peroxide) into water and Oxygen, preventin the cell grom damaging.
 - **Rhodopsin** is a light sensitive protein that is extremely sensitive to light and easily photo bleaches. It is regenerated in around 30 minutes in humans.

#### Enzymes:
 - Lactase(breacks down lactores), Lipases(group breacks down lipids), Maltase(maltose to glucose), Trypsin(protein ammino acids)
 - Enzymes function by taking substrates to the actibe site and breacking them down into products.
 - PH, Temputrue, adn substrate concetration all effected enzymatic activity, with the first two working by having a spefific zone that best suites the enzuem, the latter seems to go up log?
