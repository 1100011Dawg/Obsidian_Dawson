> Community Structure is an emergent property of an ecosystem
####  Factors affecting the distribution of plant and animal species
 - abiotic
	 - atmospheric gases
	 - wind
	 - fire
	 - light 
		 - Plants for photosynthesis
		 - visability
	 - temperature
		 - Metabolic pathways are controlled by enzymes, white have optimal temperatures which they won denature
		 - Increases the rate of evaporation
		 - Body Size for animats
	 - water
		 - relative humidity
		 - Needed for cell turgor
		 - Needed for photosynthesis
		 - (Xerophytes vs hydrophytes)
		 - For animals to lay eggs, and dissolved oxygen
	 - day length
	 - aspect
	 - PH
		 - affects availability of mineral nutrients
		 - decomposition of nater
	 - parent material
	 - salinity
		 - May make osmosis harder
		 - Halophytes are adapted
	 - wave action
	 - Breeding Sites
		 - Need to provide protection
 - Biotic
	 - Humans
	 - competitors
	 - predators
	 - parasites
 - Adapted for survival in their unique conditions
 - Plants have pH salinity, animals have breeding sites and food supply
 - 
#### Shelford law of tolerance
 - plots the range of biotic or abiotic factors that is tolerated by a species
 - Shows Optimal, zone of stress, and zone of intolerance
 - usually a bell curve
#### Symbiotic Relationships
 - Mutualism: Both benefits
	 - ex: Zooxanthellae and reef building corral species, Coral provides protection and compounds for photosynthesis, the algae provides oxygen and energy(glucose)
		 - The species is polyps
			 - They are mostly stomach
			 - Sit upon a hard skeleton that is calcium carbonate
			 - Provides Carbon Dioxide Phosphorus and Nitrogen
			 - Tentacles have Nematocysts that stings their prey
			 - Coenosarc Connects Stomachs between polyps
		 - Zooxanthellae
			 - Provides Oxygen Sugars Fats and up to 95% of energy
 - Commensalism: One Benefits and one is Unaffected
 - Parasitism: One benefits and one is harmed.
 - Predator and Prey
	 - One Organism eats the other organism and thus kills the prey.
 #### Niche
  - A specialised habitat of an organism
  - Only one species or population can occupy the same niche for an extended period of time
  - intraspecific: competition within a species for a resource
  - interspecific: competition between species for a resource
  - Fundamental niches is the full range of environmental conditions where a species could potentially live
  - Realized niche: is the specific set of conditions under which it actually does survive.
  - Competitive exclusion principle: No two species can occupy the same niche for extended periods of time.
	  - ex: Paramecium grew higher when they were in their own area
  - Niche Partitioning, a spatial, morphological or temporal partitioning of a similar resource.
 #### Type of _____
  - Predation a consumer kills and eats another organism
	  - Top down influence on lower trophic levels
  - Herborvy: Consumer eats plant matter
  - Parasitism: symbiotic relationship were the parasite benefit to the host detriment
- #### Keystone Species:
-  - Is a species which has a disproportionate effect on the structure of an ecological community
- Keystone modifier species: determine the prevalence and activities of many other species by dramatically altering the environment
	- ex: Beaver
- Keystone host species: Provide habitat for a variety of other species
#### Gersmehl diagram
 - Shows the diffrence between nutrient flow and storage
 - Sinks are:
	 - Biomass
	 - Litter(dead matter)
	 - Soil
#### Biomass
 > Biomass: total dry mass of organic matter in organisms or ecosystems
 - See how productive an ecosystem is
 - Energy Flows through a ecosystem
	 - $NP(Net production)=GP(Gross Production)-R(Resperation)$
	 - Organic matter becomes Biomass
	 - unit of energy $kJ*m^{⁻2}*y^{⁻1}$
	 - Autotroph store energy as Starch
	 - Food Conversion Ratio $FCR=\frac{mass\ of\ the\ food\ eaten(g)}{increase\ in\ desired\ output(g)}per\ time\ period$
#### Climate
 - Climate Graph: a diagram which shows the relative combination of temperature.
 - Ecological Succession
	 - The predictable and orderly changes in composition of an ecosystem over time
	 - Changes the abiotic environment
	 - Produces Microclimates
	 - Primary succession
		 - From Bare Rock
		 - Gross production increases
		 - Species diversity increases
		 - Emergence of an entirely new ecosystem
		 1. Pioneer Species
		 2. Intermediate species
		 3. Climax community
	 - Secondary Succession
		 - Replacement of one ecosystem by another following environmental change

#### Alien species
 - arrives in a non-native habitat
 - Often not adapted and is outside its niche
 - Can become invasive
	 - Leads to competitive exclusion principle
	 - Absence of Preditor
	 - Ex:
		 - Zebra mussels were released from ballast water and now dominate waterways
		 - Cane toad was tried to control the cane beetle
			 - Control pests on sugar cane
#### Biological Control:
 - Use or introduction of a species to control an other
 - EX:
	 - Releasing RHDV(virus) to control rabbit populations
#### Biomagnification
 - where chemical substances become more concentrated at higher trophic levels.
 - EX:
	 - DDT a synthetic pesticide to control malaria to control the malaria vector
#### Bioaccumulation
 - where the increase in the substance is within one trophic level
#### Plastic:
-  Broad term that describes a number of different polymers
	- Microplastic is less than 1mm
		- 65% of all ocean debris
	- Not Biodegradable
- Mistaken for food leading to suffication.

> In situ(inside natural environment), Ex situ(outside natural environment) for preservation

#### Indicator species
 - Are species that are sensitive to environmental conditions because of their limited Tolerance(shelford Law of Tolerance)

#### Kick sampling
 - Use a (Hilsenhoff)Biotic index to compare the relative frequency of indicator species
 - $BI = \frac{\sum{n_i*a_i}}{N}$
	 - $n_i$ is number of individual of a species
	 -  $a_i$ tolerance rating of the species(Bigger less tolerant)
	 -  $N$ total number of individuals collected

#### Biodiversity
 - Richness:
	 - Number of different species present
 - Evenness:
	 - If a habitat has a similar abundance for each species present.
 - Simpsons reciprocal index
	 - $D=\frac{N(N-1)}{\sum{n(n-1)}}$
		 - N:Total of all species
		 - n:Number of organism of a single species
#### Extinction
 - the end of a species
 - Anthropogenic(human caused factors)

#### In situ conservation
  - Nature reserves are protected from humans.
  - Control invasive species
  - legal protection for endangered species
  - opportunities for research
  - restoration of degraded areas
  - **Nature Reserve**
	  - Larger size is better
	  - Reserves with less edge are better
	  - Clustered reserves are better
	  - Habitat corridors are good
