> Community Structure is an emergent property of an ecosystem
####  Factors affecting the distribution of plant and animal species
 - abiotic
	 - atmospheric gases
	 - wind
	 - fire
	 - light 
		 - Plants for photosynthesis
		 - visability
	 - temperature
		 - Metabolic pathways are controlled by enzymes, white have optimal temperatures which they won denature
		 - Increases the rate of evaporation
		 - Body Size for animats
	 - water
		 - relative humidity
		 - Needed for cell turgor
		 - Needed for photosynthesis
		 - (Xerophytes vs hydrophytes)
		 - For animals to lay eggs, and dissolved oxygen
	 - day length
	 - aspect
	 - PH
		 - affects availability of mineral nutrients
		 - decomposition of nater
	 - parent material
	 - salinity
		 - May make osmosis harder
		 - Halophytes are adapted
	 - wave action
	 - Breeding Sites
		 - Need to provide protection
 - Biotic
	 - Humans
	 - competitors
	 - predators
	 - parasites
 - Adapted for survival in their unique conditions
 - Plants have pH salinity, animals have breeding sites and food supply
 - 
#### Shelford law of tolerance
 - plots the range of biotic or abiotic factors that is tolerated by a species
 - Shows Optimal, zone of stress, and zone of intolerance
 - usually a bell curve
#### Symbiotic Relationships
 - Mutualism: Both benefits
	 - ex: Zooxanthellae and reef building corral species, Coral provides protection and compounds for photosynthesis, the algae provides oxygen and energy(glucose)
		 - The species is polyps
			 - They are mostly stomach
			 - Sit upon a hard skeleton that is calcium carbonate
			 - Provides Carbon Dioxide Phosphorus and Nitrogen
			 - Tentacles have Nematocysts that stings their prey
			 - Coenosarc Connects Stomachs between polyps
		 - Zooxanthellae
			 - Provides Oxygen Sugars Fats and up to 95% of energy
 - Commensalism: One Benefits and one is Unaffected
 - Parasitism: One benefits and one is harmed.
 - Predator and Prey
	 - One Organism eats the other organism and thus kills the prey.
 #### Niche
  - A specialised habitat of an organism
  - Only one species or population can occupy the same niche for an extended period of time
  - intraspecific: competition within a species for a resource
  - interspecific: competition between species for a resource
  - Fundamental niches is the full range of environmental conditions where a species could potentially live
  - Realized niche: is the specific set of conditions under which it actually does survive.
  - Competitive exclusion principle: No two species can occupy the same niche for extended periods of time.
	  - ex: Paramecium grew higher when they were in their own area
  - Niche Partitioning, a spatial, morphological or temporal partitioning of a similar resource.
 #### Type of _____
  - Predation a consumer kills and eats another organism
	  - Top down influence on lower trophic levels
  - Herborvy: Consumer eats plant matter
  - Parasitism: symbiotic relationship were the parasite benefit to the host detriment
- #### Keystone Species:
-  - Is a species which has a disproportionate effect on the structure of an ecological community
- Keystone modifier species: determine the prevalence and activities of many other species by dramatically altering the environment
	- ex: Beaver
- Keystone host species: Provide habitat for a variety of other species
#### Gersmehl diagram
 - Shows the diffrence between nutrient flow and storage
 - Sinks are:
	 - Biomass
	 - Litter(dead matter)
	 - Soil
#### Biomass
 > Biomass: total dry mass of organic matter in organisms or ecosystems
 - See how productive an ecosystem is
 - Energy Flows through a ecosystem
	 - $NP(Net production)=GP(Gross Production)-R(Resperation)$
	 - Organic matter becomes Biomass
	 - unit of energy $kJ*m^{⁻2}*y^{⁻1}$
	 - Autotroph store energy as Starch
	 - Food Conversion Ratio $FCR=\frac{mass\ of\ the\ food\ eaten(g)}{increase\ in\ desired\ output(g)}per\ time\ period$
#### Climate
 - Climate Graph: a diagram which shows the relative combination of temperature.
 - Ecological Succession
	 - Primary succession
		 - Emergence of an entierly new ecosystem
	 - Secondary Succession
