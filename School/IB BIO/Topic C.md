> Community Structure is an emergent property of an ecosystem
####  Factors affecting the distribution of plant and animal species
 - abiotic
	 - atmospheric gases
	 - wind
	 - fire
	 - light 
		 - Plants for photosynthesis
		 - visability
	 - temperature
		 - Metabolic pathways are controlled by enzymes, white have optimal temperatures which they won denature
		 - Increases the rate of evaporation
		 - Body Size for animats
	 - water
		 - relative humidity
		 - Needed for cell turgor
		 - Needed for photosynthesis
		 - (Xerophytes vs hydrophytes)
		 - For animals to lay eggs
	 - day length
	 - aspect
	 - PH
		 - afects avalibity of mineral nutriests
		 - decomposition of nater
	 - parent material
	 - salinity
		 - May make osmosis harder
		 - Halophytes are adapted
	 - wave action
 - Biotic
	 - Humans
	 - competitors
	 - predators
	 - parasites
 - Adapted for survival in their unique conditions
 - Plants have pH salinity, animals have breeding sites and food supply
