Portiens
#### Amino Acids
 - R group makes the diffrent types of ammino acids, they always have a Amino Grou $-NH_2$ and Carboxylic Acid roup $-COOH$ then it has a hydrogen opposite to R group.

#### Protein
 - Peptide bonds are anabolism(dehydration syntehsis?) to combind them together
 - are one or more polupeptides
 - Fibrous are long and and support, insoluble
 - Globular portein, are spherical , function and soluble in water
 - Nenature, when heat/ph is not optimum.
 - **Named Proteins**
	 - Rubisco: catalyzes the ractions that fixes carbon diaoxiede from the atmosphere
	 - Insulin:hormone signals liver to asar glucose and lower blood sugar
	 - Immunoglobulins: antibodies
	 - Rhodopsin: Pigment that absorbs light
	 - Collagen:1/4 all protein in human body, part of teeth and bones
	 - Spider Silk:very strong

#### Genome/Proteome:
 - Genome: all geners of cell
 - Proteome: all proteins prudced by a cell, tissue/orgran
 - Proteme are larger than genome
