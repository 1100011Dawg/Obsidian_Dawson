DNA is antiparrel strands double helix, has sugar phosphate backbook and nirogeonou bases, DNA double, rna one uricil thymine diffrence
outline thee enzymes in DNA repiccation
 - helicase: unwinds seprates
 - polmerse 3 add nucleotides
 - polymerase1 proofrean and remove primers
 - primase adds primer for polymerase
 - ligase joins ozaki fragments
Metzel stal is ecol had N 14 15 had heavy first than N14 they they use  centrifuge, the bands after genrations showed bybrid and light DNA

component nuclesome, 2 DNA strands around 8 histores

methylation effect gneeexpretion does no allow transcriptio to occur(need know phosphorilation)

E-site: releases trna with no amino acid
A site binds incomming trna with new amino acid
holds the trna with the growing polypeptide o allow elongation

inition start strar codin , peptide bond a and p site, ploy peptide in a side mov to p site outline(could do some drawing)
