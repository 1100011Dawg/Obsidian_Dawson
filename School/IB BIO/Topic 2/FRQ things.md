DNA is antiparrel strands double helix, has sugar phosphate backbook and nirogeonou bases, DNA double, rna one uricil thymine diffrence
outline thee enzymes in DNA repiccation
 - helicase: unwinds seprates
 - polmerse 3 add nucleotides
 - polymerase1 proofrean and remove primers
 - primase adds primer for polymerase
 - ligase joins ozaki fragments
Metzel stal is ecol had N 14 15 had heavy first than N14 they they use  centrifuge, the bands after genrations showed bybrid and light DNA

component nuclesome, 2 DNA strands around 8 histores

methylation effect gneeexpretion does no allow transcriptio to occur(need know phosphorilation)

E-site: releases trna with no amino acid
A site binds incomming trna with new amino acid
holds the trna with the growing polypeptide o allow elongation

inition start strar codin , peptide bond a and p site, ploy peptide in a side mov to p site outline(could do some drawing)

hershey chase:provided evidence, two competing theries ptotein and DNA, radoactive gentic material injected into cell they found bactophages compsed of DNA dn protein, and only the DNA entries the cell. 

PCRTaq DNA polymerase is good for extreme eviroments.
steps 1 denaturation, seprate strands
anneling(cool down tto primer bind to template, extention (extend primers)
