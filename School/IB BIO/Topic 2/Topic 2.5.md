#### Enzymes:
 - Lactase(breacks down lactores), Lipases(group breacks down lipids), Maltase(maltose to glucose), Trypsin(protein ammino acids)
 - Enzymes function by taking substrates to the actibe site and breacking them down into products.
 - PH, Temputrue, adn substrate concetration all effected enzymatic activity, with the first two working by having a spefific zone that best suites the enzuem, the latter seems to go up log?
 - the pancrease produces the most digesttive enzymes, that are secreted into the small insestine
