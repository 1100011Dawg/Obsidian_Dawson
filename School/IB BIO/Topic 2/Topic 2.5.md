**Warm-Up**

##### Enzymes:
 - Lactase(breacks down lactores), Lipases(group breacks down lipids), Maltase(maltose to glucose), Trypsin(protein ammino acids)
 - Enzymes function by taking substrates to the actibe site and breacking them down into products.(enzymes are substrate spefific)
 - PH, Temputrue, adn substrate concetration all effected enzymatic activity, with the first two working by having a spefific zone that best suites the enzuem, the latter seems to go up log?
 - the pancrease produces the most digesttive enzymes, that are secreted into the small insestine


#### Human digestive enzymes:
 - Amylases breack down carbohydrates(salivia mouth)
 - Proteases breack down polypeptide(stomach)
 - Lipases brack down fats and lipids(intestine)

#### Enzyme Genral
 - Exo v Endothermic:
	- Exo energy is released
	- Endo energy is increased
	- enzymes lower activation energy
- subrates:reactant in biochemical reaction
- Enzyme: globular proteins which acts as a catalist
- Active site: region on the surface which subrates bind and catalist react
- Enzyme changes state during reaction
- Tempeture, pH and subrate effect rate fo enzyme activity, Ph and temp can cuse denaturation

#### Enzyme Types:
 - inhibitors fits on the active site if competitive
 - non-competitive inhibitors fits into a allosteric site causeing a conformational change in acctive site, leading to substrate not attching
 - competitve let all product being made, non competitive their will be less product

#### Metabolism:
 - feedback regolation, alloric recultion, using allosteric site, change shapre prevent brinting
 - Alloric recultion: endporduct inhibitor is non-copetitive inhibitor by the end product attaching to the **allosteric site**
 - A
