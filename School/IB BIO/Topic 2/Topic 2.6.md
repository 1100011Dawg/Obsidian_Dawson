 - Topoisomerase: Prevent and correct topological probelsm in DNA 
 - DNA Helicase: Motor Proteins in order to unpack genetick material
 - Primase: catalize a primer RNA complementary to a single strand of DNA 
 - DNA Polymerases(1 and 3):DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the three prime (3')-end of a DNA strand. DNA polymerase 1 is involved in the removal of primers from the fragments and replacing the gap by relevant nucleotides whereas DNA polymerase 3 is mainly involved in the synthesis of the leading and lagging strands.  
 - DNA Ligase: facilitates  joining of DNA strands together by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond

 - pyrimedies have y, thymine Cyosine
 - purine: adenine and guanine
 - paring: A to T, G to C
	 - in RNA Uricil replaces Thymine
 - They are anti parrele
 - prokayrotic naked DNA(no histomes)
 - Nucleotide: a single unit eof a nucleic acid polymere: have phosphate group, 5-C sugar(either ribose of Deoxyribose) and a Nitrogous base
 - Happens with a 5 to 3 prime direction.
 - RNA is single stranded, DNA is duouble helix(has hydrogen bonds between nucleic bases 2 or three bonds)
 - telomeres are located in the end of eukaryote chromososms, prevent loss of important genes
