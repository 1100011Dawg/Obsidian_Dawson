 - Topoisomerase: Prevent and correct topological probelsm in DNA 
 - DNA Helicase: Motor Proteins in order to unpack genetick material
 - Primase: catalize a primer RNA complementary to a single strand of DNA 
 - DNA Polymerases(1 and 3):DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the three prime (3')-end of a DNA strand. DNA polymerase 1 is involved in the removal of primers from the fragments and replacing the gap by relevant nucleotides whereas DNA polymerase 3 is mainly involved in the synthesis of the leading and lagging strands.
