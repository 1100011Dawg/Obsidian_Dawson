 - Urea: $CO(H_2N)_2$
	 - way to excrete ecsess amino acids
	 - Aritificailly used as a nitrogen fertilizer
#### Functional Groups:
- Hydroxyl(Alchohol)
- Carbonyl(Ketone Aldehyde)
- Carboxyl(Carboxylic acid or organic acid)
- Amino(Amine)
- Sulfhydryl(Thiol)
- Phosphate(Organic phosphate)
- Methyl(Methylated compound)
#### Important Molecules
 - ATP(Adenosine Triphosphate)
	 
#### Terminology
 - polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similiar buildin blocks
	 - These small building blocks are **Monomers**
 - Dehydration reaction occurs when two monomers bond together through the loss of water moledule
 - Hydrolisis is the reverse of the dehydration reaction
 - These processes are facilitated by enzymes
 - **Anabolic** builds molicules by the process of condensation(dehydration reaction)
 - **Catabolic** dreadk down moledules by Hydrolysis
