> sublimate: from solid to gass, no liquid
#### Water coolant
 - high tmepatrues damage tissue and denature proteins
 - Take a lot of gnergy for water to evaporate, thus it removes a lot of energy
#### Compents transeed by blood
 - Glucose is polar and is carried in disssolved blood plasma
 - Oxygen, transported by hemaglobin, to easyly saturates it.
#### Polarity of water
 - leads to hydrogen bonding
 - Oxygen is -, Hydrogen is +
 - Cohesion with water molecules stiking to each other
	 - Surface tension, caused by cohesive hydrogen bonding
 - Adhesion, the polarity of water allows water to stick to other substances
	 - Capillar action is caused by the combination of adhesiona dn cohesion
	
#### Transpiration of water
 - water is continually evaporating from the leave cells exposed to air
 - This provides evaportive cooling and nutrient uptake(water has high energy to evaporate)
 - When tranpirating the stomata is open allowing CO2 to come in. 
 - The cohesive properties of water allowing water to come up to be eaportated
 - Steps `1.Water is passively transported into the roots and then into the xylem.
2.The forces of cohesion and adhesion cause the water molecules to form a column in the xylem.
3.Water moves from the xylem into the mesophyll cells, evaporates from their surfaces and leaves the plant by diffusion through the stomata`
