Enzymes:
 - DNA Helicase unzips the DNA, creates replication fork, results in leading strand, lagging strand
 - SSB´ attach to DNA so it wont coil up
 - DNA Primase, sets down small segment of RNA to get DNA polymerase to get going
 - DNA Polymerase
	 - Polymerase 3 goes on the leading strand, joins up oppisites
	 - Polymersase 1 goes on lagging strand
	 - have 3 phosphate than uses enegy to remove 2 phsophate and have the bond
 DNA
  - made up of nucleotieds(sugar, phospurus nitrogenous base)
  - pyramidines:thymine, cytosine
  - Purines(2 rings): Adenine, Guanine
  - 2 bonds A-T 3 bonds G-C

DNA Replication:
 - DNA polymerase moves in a 5´ to 3´ direaction.(building, on the strands looks like 3-->5)
 - Cromosomes made up chomatine, with nucleasomes than DNA
