Enzymes:
 - DNA Helicase unzips the DNA, creates replication fork, results in leading strand, lagging strand
 - SSB´ attach to DNA so it wont coil up
 - DNA Primase, sets down small segment of RNA to get DNA polymerase to get going
 - DNA Polymerase
	 - Polymerase 3 goes on the leading strand, joins up oppisites(leading strand goes to the fork) also does  lagging strand, creating ozaki fragments
	 - Polymersase 1 goes on lagging strand removing the RNA primers
	 - have 3 phosphate than uses enegy to remove 2 phsophate and have the bond
 - DNA Ligase joins up the ozaki fragments
 - DNA polymerase one allso checks for error, also 3 at end
 DNA
  - made up of nucleotieds(sugar, phospurus nitrogenous base)
  - pyramidines:thymine, cytosine
  - Purines(2 rings): Adenine, Guanine
  - 2 bonds A-T 3 bonds G-C

DNA Replication:
 - DNA polymerase moves in a 5´ to 3´ direaction.(building, on the strands looks like 3-->5)
 - Cromosomes made up chomatine, with nucleasomes than DNA
 - is semi onservative, so one strain of the orignal remains in each

PCR:
 - PCR is a way of producitng large qualtites of RNA/DNA
	 - denaturation, DNA is heated to seperate strands
	 - Annealing, DNA primers attach to oppiste ends of target sequence
	 - Elongation: a heat-tolerant DNA polyemrase(Taq) copies the strand)

Trasncrpition:
 - Exons: spliced together
 - Erons: splieced out
 - Transction: in the nucleos, the gene sequence is copied to mRNA(U replaces T)
 - hppens 5 to 3 prime direction
 - only some genes are transcibed and translated
 
 
 Translation: The ribosome makes proteins by reading the mRNA translating to amino acids. their are start/stop codons( AUG, and UAA/UAG/UGA respectivly, when transcribing the codon chart is for mRNA and start at AUG no metter what.
  - ribosomes have two subunits(each being small and large)
  - 
> three type RNA: mRNA(messenger), tRNA(transfer amino acid), rRNA(ribosomes RNA)


Restriction enzymes cut out a small part of plasmid with ligase joining them together.

#### Epigenetics:
  - Cuased by modification of gene expression rather than genetic code.
	  - Siamese cats have a pigment protein that only express at low tempetures(extremenines)
  - Nucleasome(tightly coiled DNA around histomes) cant have transcription occur
  - Methylated ctosines, with deacetylated histomes swiches of transcription, it is possitble if itw as unmethelated
  - Methly group:decreases transcitpion
  - Acetyl group, increases strancition.(neatrelize charge)
