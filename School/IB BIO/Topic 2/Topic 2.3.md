#### Monosacharides:
 - Are monomers linked together by condesnsation reactions to form disaccharides and polysaccharises
 - Glucose $C_6H_{12}O_6$
	 - 5 of the carbons form cornes on the rind, with the 6 taken by oxygen
 - Galactose:$C_6H_{12}O_6$ also a hextose sugar
	 - HO and O are fliped from glucose
 - Fructose: Pensote sugar
 - Ribose: pentose sugar, forms backbone RNA
	 - Deoxyribose differs and forms the backbone of DNA(has one liess oxygen thant ribose)
#### polysaccharides
 - Disacarides:
	 - 2Glucose --> maltose, dimer of glucose
	 - Glucose + Galactose--> Lactose
	 - glucose + Fructosee --> Sucrose
 - Celluose: long chains of Glucose, very high tensile strach
 - Starch: linking togerterh a-glucose molecules, sci name Amylose/Amylopectin
	 - Curved molcues
 - Glycogen: made from repeading glucose subunites
	 - Branches many times
 - Chitin
## Fats:
 - Lipids are glycerol combined with 1,2,3 fatty acids
	  - Tryclycerieds are formed by the condestation of three fatty acids and one glycerol
	  - Functions:
		  - sturcture for cell membrane
		  - hormaonal signaling(steroids)
		  - Insulation
		  - Protection(around key orgains)
		  - Storage of eenryg
	  - 9Cal/g compared to carhohydrates 4Cal/g
