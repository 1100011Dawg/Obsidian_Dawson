#### Monosacharides:
 - Are monomers linked together by condesnsation reactions to form disaccharides and polysaccharises
 - Glucose $C_6H_{12}O_6$
	 - 5 of the carbons form cornes on the rind, with the 6 taken by oxygen
 - Galactose:$C_6H_{12}O_6$ also a hextose sugar
	 - HO and O are fliped from glucose
 - Fructose: Pensote sugar
 - Ribose: pentose sugar, forms backbone RNA
	 - Deoxyribose differs and forms the backbone of DNA(has one liess oxygen thant ribose)
#### polysaccharides
 - 2Glucose --> maltose
