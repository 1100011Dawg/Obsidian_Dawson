Ecology: The study of relationships between living organisms and between organism and their environment
 - Population: A group of organisms of the  same species living in the same area at the same time
	 - Community: A group of populations living and interacting with each other in an area
	 - Species: A group of organisms that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring
		 - Habitat: The environment in which a species normally lives.
- Ecosystem:  A community and its abiotic environment
**Feeding Methods**
	- Autotrophy: Organisms which produce their won food from organic molecules(make own Carbon substances)
		- Producers:
			- Photoautotrophy: Photosynthesis
			- Chemoautotrophy: Chemothesis
	- Heterotroph: Organisms which derive energy from other living organism(OBtains Carbon substances from others)
		- Consumers: Ingest organic matter which is living or recently killed
			- Primary: Eat producers(herbivores)
			- Secondary Eat other consumers(carnivores, omnivores)
		- Decomposers: Derive energy from non-living organic matter
			- Detritivores: Ingest non-living organic matter
			- Saprotrophs: Lives in or on non living organic matter, secreting digestive enzymes into it and absorbing the products.
	- Mixotroph: Appears to be both Heterotrophic and Autotrophic
**Food Chains**:shows the flow of energy through the trophic levels of a feeding relationship
**Trophic level**: feeding position of an organism in a food chain
	- Primary
	- Secondary
	- tertiary
	- quaternary
**Quadrat Sampling**: using quadrant placed randomly to record the number of organisms present.
	- Can be used to estimate population density, and the distribution
	- Systematically with belt transect to measure changing distribution
	- Randomly to estimate population density
**Chi squared GOF**
	- Determine if data fits a distribution
	- $$\chi²=\frac{\sum{(Obeserved*Expected)²}}{Expected}$$
	-*Ho*:null hypothesis, *Ha*:Alternative hypothesis
	- Conditions: SRS, categorical,expected values >=5, counts>=10
	- Conclusion: Reject(or failed reject) Ho since p-value < a(.05) or(X²>Critical Value) thus we have evidence for Ha. 
	- $DF = n-1$
**Chi Squared**
	- Comparing factors in a matrix for association
	- $\frac{Row Total*Column Total}{Grand Total}=Expected Value$
	- $DF=(Column\#-1)*(Row\# -1)$
#### Inorganic Nutrients
 - Nitrogen and phosphorus
 - Approximately fifteen other elements are needed by living organisms.
 - Goes through biotic and abiotic environments through the **Nutrient Cycle**
 #### Respiration: 
 - Converting Carbon products to energy(ATP).
 - carbon compounds such as carbohydrates and lipids are oxidized
> Biomass: Total dry mass of a group of organisms
> 10% rule: only 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next. Heat released from cell respiration, Organic material not consumed, not all parts digested, all are reasons for energy loss.

#### Pyramids of energy
 - Shoes the flow of energy between trophic levels
 - Measured in Units of energy per unit area per unit time( $kJ*m^{-2} * y^{-1}$

#### Carbon Cycle
 - Carbon Source:
	 - Respiration
	 - Combustion
	 - Methane Emissions
 - Carbon Sinks:
	 - Photosynthesis(carbon fixation)
	 - Decomposition
	 - Fossilisation
#### Carbon Stores:
 - Atmosphere Carbon Store
 - Ocean Carbon Store
 - Biosphere Carbon Store
 - Permafrost
 - Fossil Fuels
 - Limestone & Dolomite(lithosphere)
