Ecology: The study of relationships between living organisms and between organism and their environment
 - Population: A group of organisms of the  same species living in the same area at the same time
	 - Species: A group of organisms that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring
		 - Habitat: The environment in which a species normally lives.
- Ecosystem:  A community and its abiotic environment
**Feeding Methods**
	- Autotrophy: Organisms which produce their won food from organic molecules
		- Producers:
			- Photoautotrophy: Photosynthesis
			- Chemoautotrophy: Chemothesis
	- Heterotroph: Organisms which derive energy from other living organism
		- Consumers: Ingest organic matter which is living or recently killed
			- Primary: Eat producers(herbivores)
			- Secondary Eat other consumers(carnivores, omnivores)
		- Decomposers: Derive energy from non-living organic matter
			- Detritivores: Ingest non-living organic matter
			- Saprotrophs: Lives in or on non living organic matter, secreting digestive enzymes into it and absorbing the products.
**Food Chains**:shows the flow of energy through the trophic levels of a feeding relationship
**Trophic level: feeding posistion of an organism in a food chain**
