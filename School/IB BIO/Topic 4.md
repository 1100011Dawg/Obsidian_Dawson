**Feeding Methods**
	- Autotrophy: Organisms which produce their won food from organic molecules
		- Producers:
			- Photoautotrophy: Photosynthesis
			- Chemoautotrophy: Chemothesis
	- Heterotroph: Organisms which derive energy from other living organism
		- Consumers: Ingest organic matter which is living or recently killed
			- Primary: Eat producers(herbivores)
			- Secondary Eat other consumers(carnivores, omnivores)
		- Decomposers: Derive energy from non-living organic matter
			- Detritivores: Ingest non-living organic matter
			- Saprotrophs: Lives in or on non living organic matter, secreting digestive enzymes into it and absorbing the products.
