#### Pastuer
 - Disprovved spontanious generation
 - Genetic code is universtal, with 64 codons
	 - Codon has 3 DNA bases
 - Earths earyl atmosphere was ¨reducing" in the early days
#### Miler and Urey
 - Monomers mixed in ¨primeval soup¨
 - They recreated these conditions in 1954

 - They heated the water, and sparked eletricity through gases

#### Formation of early life
 - phospholipids and other amphipathic in the right conditions assemble into bilayers
 - RNA can store information and self-replitcate
 - Endosymbiotic states that organelles orginated as symbiotes	
	 - the mito condria/chloroplast got enclosed by an infloded plasma membrane
	 - supported by mitocondira having their own dna, have 70s ribosomes, doublemembrane, synthesize own protiens, produces  y divition of pre-existing mitocondira/chloroplasts
