####Membrane fluidity:####
 - Membranes need to b fluid so the cell can move,
 - have substances move across it
 - Cholesterol:
	 - Reduces membrane fluidity, prevent tails rom crystallising
	 - Reduces permeability to hydrophilic molecules
 - Hydrophobic tail, hydrophilic head
 - Current Model:Singer-Nicholson fluid mosaic model
 - Past model: Davson-Danielli Model
	 - Proten lipid sandwhitch, proteins don't permeate the lipid bilayer
