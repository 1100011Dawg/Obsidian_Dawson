 > multicellular organisms allow for cell specialization, and replacement
#### Magnification
 - $\frac{scalebarmeasurement}{sclaebarlabel}=Magnification$
 - $Calculatedsize=\frac{Measuredlangth}{Magnification}$
#### Cell theory
 - Cell is the smallest unit of life
 - Organelles cannot survive alone
 - cells only arise from preexisting cells
 - Meiosis generates haploid gametes(sex cells)
 - Mitosis results in identical daughter cells
 - Cell changlage cell theory
	 - Muscle cell are multinucleated
	 - colonial organism, long with multi-nucleated, chitin cell wall, cytoplasm is continuous along the hyphae(for aseptate fungal hyphae)
	 - giant algae, one nucleus 5-100mm
#### Cell functions(functions of life) Mr. H Gern
 - Metabolism
 - Response
 - Homeostasis
 - Growth
 - Excretion
 - Reproduction
 - Nutrition
