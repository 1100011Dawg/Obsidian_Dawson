 > multicellular organisms allow for cell specialization, and replacement
#### Magnification
 - $\frac{scalebarmeasurement}{sclaebarlabel}=Magnification$
 - $Calculatedsize=\frac{Measuredlangth}{Magnification}$
#### Cell theory
 - Cell is the smallest unit of life
 - Organelles cannot survive alone
 - cells only arise from preexisting cells
 - Meiosis generates haploid gametes(sex cells)
 - Mitosis results in identical daughter cells
 - Cell changlage cell theory
	 - Muscle cell are multinucleated
	 - colonial organism, long with multi-nucleated, chitin cell wall, cytoplasm is continuous along the hyphae(for aseptate fungal hyphae)
	 - giant algae, one nucleus 5-100mm
#### Cell functions(functions of life) Mr. H Gern
 - Metabolism
 - Response
 - Homeostasis
 - Growth
 - Excretion
 - Reproduction
 - Nutrition
#### Square cube law
 - Square cube law, volume grows faster than surface area with that ratio getting more askew.
 - Diffusion pathways are shorter
 - Concetration gradients are easier to generate
 > Emergent property: atoms -> molecules -> cells -> Tissues-> organ -> Organ systems -> Organism ->
#### Differentiation
 - All diploids share identical genome
 - 220 distinct types of stells
 - Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can turn into in cell, Types:
	 - Totipotent any type of cell
	 - Pluripotent, differentiate into many types of cell
	 - Multipotent:differentiate into closely related types of cells
	 - Unipotent: can regenerate buy can only differentiated into their associated cell type
 - Stem cells
	 - Embryonic stem cells(generated by IVF)(need destruction of embryo almost unlimited, high tumor risk)(not gnetically identical to the patient)
	 - Cord blood(easily obtained and storeid but limited)(limited, ethical, low risk tumour)
	 - Adult(difficult to obtain deep in tissue)(limited can get permission, low risk tumour)(can have accumulation of mutations)
 - IPS(induced pluripotent) restore differntiated cells to pluripotent cells
#### Stem cell
 - Diseases:
	 - StargardtÅ› macular dystrophy
		 - (progressive blindness)
		 - embryonic stem cells become retinal cells treat disease
	 - Leukemia
		 - cancer of blood/bone marrow resulting in poorly-functioning white blood cells
		 - HSC(hematopoietic Stem Cells) transplant into bone marrow
#### Questions:
 - I think the benefits of stem cells pose more of an advantage to a society than draw backs, because both the medical applications it has, and the ways we can avoid negative side effects(such as using adult stem cells with IPS to not harvest stem cells from embryos). The potential application on Stargardt's macular dystrophy, leukemia, and bone transplants are important.
 - I believe that life begins at fertilization because that is when the cell is able the replicate and continue the cycle of life. Their is also metabolism and all that other good stuff.
 - Due to its current state it(embryo) has some rights at around the moral worth of a fish or less.
