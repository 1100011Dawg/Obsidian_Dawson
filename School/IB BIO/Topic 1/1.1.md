 > multicellular organisms allow for cell specialization, and replacement
#### Magnification
 - $\frac{scalebarmeasurement}{sclaebarlabel}=Magnification$
 - $Calculatedsize=\frac{Measuredlangth}{Magnification}$
#### Cell theory
 - Cell is the smallest unit of life
 - Organelles cannot survive alone
 - cells only arise from preexisting cells
 - Meiosis generates haploid gametes(sex cells)
 - Mitosis results in identical daughter cells
 - Cell changlage cell theory
	 - Muscle cell are multinucleated
	 - colonial organism, long with multi-nucleated, chitin cell wall, cytoplasm is continuous along the hyphae(for aseptate fungal hyphae)
	 - giant algae, one nucleus 5-100mm
#### Cell functions(functions of life) Mr. H Gern
 - Metabolism
 - Response
 - Homeostasis
 - Growth
 - Excretion
 - Reproduction
 - Nutrition
#### Square cube law
 - Square cube law, volume grows faster than surface area with that ratio getting more askew.
 - Diffusion pathways are shorter
 - Concetration gradients are easier to generate
 > Emergent property: atoms -> molecules -> cells -> Tissues-> organ -> Organ systems -> Organism ->
#### Differentiation
 - All diploids share identical genome
 - 220 distinct types of stells
 - Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can turn into in cell, Types:
	 - Totipotent any type of cell
	 - Pluripotent, differentiate into many types of cell
	 - Multipotent:differentiate into closely related types of cells
	 - Unipotent: can regenerate buy can only differentiated into their associated cell type
 - Stem cells
	 - Embryonic stem cells(generated by IVF)(need destruction of embryo almost unlimited, high tumor risk)(not gnetically identical to the patient)
	 - Cord blood(easily obtained and storeid but limited)(limited, ethical, low risk tumour)
	 - Adult(difficult to obtain deep in tissue)(limited can get permission, low risk tumour)(can have accumulation of mutations)
