#### Prokaryotes
 - Prokaryotes:Before nucleus
 - Bacteria, and Archaea
 - Have no nucleus, have circular and naked DNA
 - 7 Sveberg ribosomes
 - Have a capsule, cell wall than plasma membrane
 - pilli: attach to other bacteria
 - nucleoid: closed loop of bacterial DNA
 - flagella: casuses movement
 - undergoes binary fission to reproduce
 - plasmid: independent small circle of DNA

#### Organelles Eukaryotic
 - Cell membrane(plasma membrane):
	 - is a phospholipid bilayer, permeable to $O_2$ and $CO_2$
 - Nucleus: 
	 - membrance bound contains Chromosomes
	 - Double layer membrance
	 - mRNA is transcribed from DNA
 - Rough endoplasmic reticulum: ribosomes on rough ER produces protiens to be exported(some where else in the body)
 - Smouth Endoplasmic reticulum: Breacks down toxins, Lipid production
 - Cytoplasm: contains many enzyles and solutes
 - Golgi apparatus:flattened stack of membrances, modifires and packages protiens
 - Lysosomes: One membrane, full of enzymes to digest bacteria, virusus and large molecules for recycling
 - Mitochondrion: smouther outer membrane and folded inner membrane, site of aerobic respiration
 - Free Riosomes 80s sized in eukaryotes(70s in prokaryotes)
 - Proteins synthesized for use within the cell
