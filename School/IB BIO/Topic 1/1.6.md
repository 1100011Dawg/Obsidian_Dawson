 - G1 Interphase
	 - Increase volue of cytoplasm
	 - Organelles produced
		 - Proteins synthesised
	 - S Interphase
		 - DNA replication
	 - G2 Interphase
		 - Increase volume of cytoplasm
		 - Organelles produced
		 - Proteins synthesised
#### Chromosomes
 - Goes from Chromosome -> Chromatine -> Nucleosomes ->  DNA helix
 - Histones are proteins they wrap around
 - Centromere: links sister chromatids
 - Sister chromatids are duplicated chromosoes attaches by a centromre
 - Chromosomes are supercoiled 
 - Chromosomes can be doubled to contain two chromatids but still one chromosome.
#### Mitosis Phases
 - ¨pass me a taco chef¨
 - Prophase: DNA supercoils, centromosemes move to opposite posles and start forming spindle fibers, nuclear memebrane breacks down.(has 92 chromosmes for humans)
 - Metaphse:Spindle fibers attach to centromoes of each pair sister chromatids
 - Anaphase: contracts the chromotides from each other
 - Telephase, chromosomes begain to uncoil and nuclear membranes start to form
 - Cytokinesis
