#### GATE(when mitosis is required)
 - Growth
 - Asexual Reproduction
 - Tissue Repair
 - Embryonic develpment
#### Cell Cycle
 - Mitosis
 - Interphase
 - Cary out normal functions:Mr.POD
	 - Metabolic reactions
	 - Protein synthesis
	 - Organelles numvers are increased
	 - DNA is replicated
 - G1 Interphase
	 - Increase volue of cytoplasm
	 - Organelles produced
		 - Proteins synthesised
	 - S Interphase
		 - DNA replication
	 - G2 Interphase
		 - Increase volume of cytoplasm
		 - Organelles produced
		 - Proteins synthesised
 - Cyclins control the cell cycle
	 - Cyclin binds to enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases
	 - These kinases activate and attach to phosphate groups to othe rporteins in the cell
	 - Attaching the phos[hate triggers the other portiens to become active
#### Chromosomes
 - Goes from Chromosome -> Chromatine -> Nucleosomes ->  DNA helix
 - Histones are proteins they wrap around
 - Centromere: links sister chromatids
 - Sister chromatids are duplicated chromosoes attaches by a centromre
 - Chromosomes are supercoiled 
 - Chromosomes can be doubled to contain two chromatids but still one chromosome.
#### Mitosis Phases
 - ¨people meet and talk¨
 - Prophase: DNA supercoils, centromosemes move to opposite posles and start forming spindle fibers, nuclear memebrane breacks down.(has 92 chromosmes for humans)
 - Metaphse:Spindle fibers attach to centromoes of each pair sister chromatids
 - Anaphase: contracts the chromotides from each other
 - Telephase, chromosomes begain to uncoil and nuclear membranes start to form
 - Cytokinesis(not part of mitosis)
	 - In animals a contrctile protin pulls the plasma membrane inward producing a clevage furrow
	 - In plants cell plate starts to deveolp with celluose, Vesicles help with this

 > $Mitotic\_Index = \frac{Cells\_in\_Mitosis}{Total\#ofcells}$

#### Cancer
 - Tumours are cell growths resulting from uncontroaled division.
	- Bening tumours: Don´t spread
- Malignat Tumours: spread
	 - Metastasis,  on tumour spreads from one location to the next
 - Diases caused by the growth of tumours are collectively called **Cancer**
	 - **Mutagens**: Agent that chcanges genetic material(on DNA or replicative machinery)
		 - Three types: Physical, Biological, and Chemical
			 - EX: xray, arsenic, viruses
		 - If they lead to the formation of cancer they are clasified as **Carcinogens**
	 - **Oncogenes**: gneers with potential to cause cancer
		 - Proto-oncogenes: stimulate cell ccles and promote cell growth
		 - Tumour suppressor genes: code for proteins that repress cell cycle, and promote apoptosis
