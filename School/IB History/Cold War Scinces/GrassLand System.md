#### Pryanishnikov
 -Insisted on mineral fertilizers and one year period of clover to improve admixture [^3]
 
 #### Vil’yams
  - 1935-1937 Vil’yams’ tried to force it's adoption[^1]
	 - Was not experimentally tested
 - 1937 first draft of law[^2]
 - Only 2-3 years of clover with other plants
 - Promised: 100 to 160 centners per  hectare yields of wheat[^5]
 - Followed by Lyashchenko[^6]
 - Exaggerated the role of soil structure in retention of moisture and exaggerated roe of perennial grasses in soil texture[^7]
 - Tulaikov was against it[^8] 


[^1]:“It may be appropriate to give some examples of the  methods whereby Vil’yams’ supporters attempted, in 1935—  1937, to force nationwide acceptance of the grassland system,  although it was never subjected to experimental tests before  or after its adoption”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 87)

[^2]:“In 1937 the grassland system reached the level of a state problem, and the first draft of a law to adopt it throughout the country was prepared”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 89)

[^3]:“Vil’yams and Pryanishnikov schools. The latter  insisted on the development of mineral fertilizers, one-year  planting of clover without cereal grass admixture (thus improving the nitrogen balance of the soil)” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 89)

[^4]:“Vil’yams, on the other hand, proposed not to develop the  fertilizer industry; to expand clover planting to two to three  years running, and only in mixtures with timothy and other  cereal grasses”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 90)

[^5]:“How  was he able to hypnotize the planning organs into accepting  on faith his fantastic promises of 100 to 160 centners per  hectare yields of wheat merely from decomposition of roots  of perennial cereals?”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 91)

[^6]:“Several months later the issue of sabotage in agricu tural chemistry was dredged up again by another Vil’yams follower, Lyashchenko”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 92)

[^7]:“Vil’yams’ hypothesis greatly exaggerated the role of soil structure in the retention of moisture and similarly exaggerated the role of perennial grasses in the development of soil texture.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 96)

[^8]:“Although Tulaikov perished in the fight against Vil’yams’  system, Vil’yams apparently cannot be personally accused of  his death”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 97)
