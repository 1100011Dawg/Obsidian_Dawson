[^1]:“It may be appropriate to give some examples of the  methods whereby Vil’yams’ supporters attempted, in 1935—  1937, to force nationwide acceptance of the grassland system,  although it was never subjected to experimental tests before  or after its adoption”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 87)

[^2]:“In 1937 the grassland system reached the level of a state problem, and the first draft of a law to adopt it throughout the country was prepared”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 89)

[^3]:“Vil’yams and Pryanishnikov schools. The latter  insisted on the development of mineral fertilizers, one-year  planting of clover without cereal grass admixture (thus improving the nitrogen balance of the soil)” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 89)
