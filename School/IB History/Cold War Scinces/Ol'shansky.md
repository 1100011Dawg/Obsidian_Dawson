 - Tried a last article supporting Lysenko[^1]


Footnotes:

[^1]:“But the style chosen by Ol’shansky for his article was not  suitable for the 1963 environment. The Soviet scientific community had become more mature, and the methods and tactics chosen by Ol’shansky by then worked against him” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 211)
