[^1]:  “author’s three points of view: as  historian; as a witness to the events; and as an active participant  in the last stages of Lysenkoism, which he helped to topple.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 9)

“This book consists of three parts. The first two  
were written in 1961-1962 and augmented in 1963-1964; the  
third was written in 1966-1967”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 22)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 10) Here is one scientist who was a Darwinist that was slandered as well as his students

“Promoters of such shaky and insecure trends usually seek support from any popular names, and frequently cite as authorities deceased and (obligatorily) native scientists.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29) Instance of Lyndon saying there work derives from someone who isn’t a genetisict and one who still supported the gene theory

“the scientific discussion on genetics was  
transformed into a debate against the “enemies of the people”  
in the pages of the journal Yarovizatsya, the founder and  
chief editor of which was Lysenko”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 46)

“the Darwinian bases of the  
biology of development, in the Leningrad State University, was an¬  
nihilated.1”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 47)

“Among the accomplices of the enemies of the people named  
in this article were such scientists as the academicians Vavilov,  
M. M. Zavadovsky, and Konstantinov, who were charged  
with an inimical attitude toward Lysenko’s work”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 53)
d





“But you proceed from immutability of genes and of the  
nature of plants.””  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 59)





(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 62) Come back to this dialogue

“Marxism is the only science. Darwinism is only a part; the  
real theory of knowledge of the world was given by Marx, Engels,  
and Lenin. And when I hear discussion about Darwinism without  
mention of Marxism, it may seem, on the one side, that all is  
right, but on the other, it’s a horse of a different color”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 63)

“The proposals for introduction of hybrid corn in the  
U.S.S.R. were based on its success in the United States where  
its use had increased yields by 20 to 30 per cent on millions  
of acres”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 64)

“But this progressive practice met the  
sharp resistance of Lysenko, Prezent, Ol’shansky, and others,”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 64)

“and his low level of culture lead to a  
peculiar introduction of ideas that are close to outmoded scientific  
views (Lamarckism),”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 66)

“On his visits to AIPB in Leningrad, the president deliberately  
emphasizes, before meetings of the scientific workers, his cate¬  
gorical disagreements with the director”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 66)






“Vavilov himself noted Shundenko’s il¬  
literacy and disruptive role”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 71)

“Little is known so far of Vavilov’s last period of life, spent  
in the Saratov prison”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 73)




“In 1936—  
1937 the problems of hereditarily determined diseases were  
only at the stage of preliminary investigation and elucidation  
of hereditary patholog”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 78)








“It may be appropriate to give some examples of the  
methods whereby Vil’yams’ supporters attempted, in 1935—  
1937, to force nationwide acceptance of the grassland system,  
although it was never subjected to experimental tests before  
or after its adoption”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 87)

“In 1937 the grassland system reached the level of a state prob¬  
lem, and the first draft of a law to adopt it throughout the  
country was prepared”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 89)

“Vil’yams and Pryanishnikov schools. The latter  
insisted on the development of mineral fertilizers, one-year  
planting of clover without cereal grass admixture (thus im¬  
proving the nitrogen balance of the soil)”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 89)

“Vil’yams, on the other hand, proposed not to develop the  
fertilizer industry; to expand clover planting to two to three  
years running, and only in mixtures with timothy and other  
cereal grasses”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 90)

“How  
was he able to hypnotize the planning organs into accepting  
on faith his fantastic promises of 100 to 160 centners per  
hectare yields of wheat merely from decomposition of roots  
of perennial cereals?”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 91)

“Several months later the issue of sabotage in agricul¬  
tural chemistry was dredged up again by another Vil’yams  
follower, Lyashchenko”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 92)

“Vavilov, whose fate has already been recounted, was a  
student of Pryanishnikov’s, and they were very fond of each  
other”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 95)

“Vil’yams’ hypothesis greatly exag¬  
gerated the role of soil structure in the retention of moisture  
and similarly exaggerated the role of perennial grasses in the  
development of soil texture.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 96)

“Although Tulaikov perished in the fight against Vil’yams’  
system, Vil’yams apparently cannot be personally accused of  
his death”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 97)

“The immediate cause of the annihilation of Tulai-  
kov’s school was an article by Stoletov, “Against foreign  
theories in agronomy,” published in the central press on  
April ii, 1937.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 97)

“his pupils and followers took full advantage  
of the overblown cult of Vil’yams to secure for themselves  
dominant positions in many responsible posts. These men  
(Bushinsky, Chizhevsky, Dmitriev, Demidov, Avaev, and  
others), having contributed nothing either to science or to  
practice, lived off the exploitation of Vil’yams’ unmerited  
glory”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 98)


“On  
November 5, 1945, Lysenko first gave his paper, which denied  
the existence of intraspecific competition among plants and  
animals in nature”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 105)

“On reading the article, which he, himself, had originally  
asked for, Lysenko became enraged and categorically refused  
to print it in his journa”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 105)

“How to explain why bourgeois biology values so highly the “theory”  
of intraspecific competition? Because it must justify the fact that,  
in the capitalist society, the great majority of people, in a period  
of overproduction of material goods, lives poorly”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 107)

“These measures included the  
planting of winter varieties on unplowed stubble in Siberia,  
which caused severe damage to Siberian”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 111)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 112) Around 1948 young scientists doubted Lysenko, so he tried to consolidate his power.



“Difficulties were even  
experienced in citing foreign authors in articles and books.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)

“This was the situation  
exploited by Lysenko, who declared genetics to be a tool of  
reactionary American imperialism.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)







“But even this decree was not implemented. There were no  
elections until 1956, when Lysenko left the post of president,  
and then they were conducted by open balloting”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 116)

“Stalin’s participation in this affair was based on Lysenko’s  
misinforming him about the real situation in biology”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 118)

“Bourgeois genetics has become the fashionable “science” abroad,  
propagandizing “eugenics” and race politics. Weismannism-Mor¬  
ganism serves today in the arsenal of contemporary imperialism as  
a means for providing a “scientific base” for its reactionary poli¬  
tics.16”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 119)

“decreed the  
abolition of a number of laboratories pronounced hotbeds of re¬  
actionary Morganism (the laboratories of cytogenetics, botan¬  
ical cytology, phenogenesis, and others)”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 123)

“Within two days alone (August 23-24, 1948), Kaftanov  
issued a series of detailed orders published in pamphlet form  
and sent to every institution of higher learning. Order No.  
1208 (August 23, 1948), regarding universities, decreed (point  
2) the dismissal from Moscow University of those who ac¬  
tively fought against Michurinism, including the professor of  
Darwinism, Shmal’gauzen, the professor of developmental  
biology, M. M. Zavadovsky, the professor of plant physiology,  
Sabinin, the dean of the faculty, Yudintsev, and assistant pro¬  
fessors Alikhanyan, Zelikman, Berman, and Shapiro”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 124)

“For instance, there was an order to destroy all  
stocks of Drosophila”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 125)

“Thus, the Minister  
of Agriculture, Benediktov, issued an order (No. 1530, Octo¬  
ber 6, 1948) decreeing cessation of all genetic research in  
animal husbandry;”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 126)

“His assignment apparently had been to  
watch Zhukovsky’s school.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 129)

“Art stores sold busts  
and bas-reliefs of Lysenko”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 131)

“Merrily play on, accordion,  
With my girl friend let me sing  
Of the eternal glory of Academician Lysenko.  
He walks the Michurin path  
With firm tread;  
He protects us from being duped  
by Mendelist-Morganists.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 132)

“Lysenko exclaims  
with exaltation: “Aha! You came to relearn?””  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 132)

“Cybernetics was likewise  
declared reactionary, and remained underground until 1955.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

“discredited merely on the grounds that they had been de¬  
veloped in the United States”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

“And they began by declaring reactionary  
and idealistic Einstein’s relativity theory (“reactionary Ein-  
steinism”), Bohr’s complementary principle, Pauling’s theory  
of resonance, and a number of other concepts that were land¬  
marks in science.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

“biology by the theory of neo-Lamarckism, which is sup¬  
planting neo-Darwinism.”37”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 136)

“Immoderate  
praise and complete suppression of criticism were typical for  
only four years”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 136)

“The sympathies of  
scientists and of youth were with the Botanichesky Zhurnal.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“The  
Botanichesky Zhurnal rapidly became the most popular bio¬  
logical periodical, and its every issue was awaited with impa¬  
tience.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“The pseudoscientific work of Lepeshinskaya was de¬  
bunked in short order. By the end of 1955 more than three  
hundred scientists had signed a petition requesting Lysenko’s  
removal from the post of LAAAS president and the dismissal  
of Oparin as secretary of the Biological Section of the AS”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“Lysenko and  
his supporters once more succeeded in evoking administrative  
reprisals against their opponents. The editorial board of the  
Botanichesky Zhurnal was disbanded at the end of 1958 and  
reconstituted largely from Lysenko’s followers”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 138)

“This unique volume was also translated into  
languages of friendly socialist states, some of which, unfor¬  
tunately, adopted the Soviet “experience” of persecution of  
genetics”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 141)

“And here is what the pillars of Lysenkoism asserted in 1961-  
1963, when the mechanism of gene action on the molecular  
level had already been discovered, and biology had emerged  
at the forefront of the natural sciences:”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

“The assertion that  
there are in an organism some minute particles, genes, responsi¬  
ble for the transmission of hereditary traits is pure fantasy  
without any basis in science.””  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 147) Come back for false criticism of genetics

“With the aid of this doc¬  
trine, attempts are made to justify the exploitation of workers,  
colonialism, and racial discrimination”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 148)

“In general, in talking of the inauspicious contributions of  
Lysenko’s followers, to be fair, it must be pointed out that they  
formed a relatively small group of theoreticians.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 150)

“After all, it is said, Lysenko and his followers are in close touch with the practical application of research to problems of agriculture; they settle disputes in the field, and not with useless fruit flies. This is a widespread point of view and, unless it is analyzed, final judgment is not possible.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 151)
