were written in 1961-1962 and augmented in 1963-1964; the  
third was written in 1966-1967”

“Promoters of such shaky and insecure trends usually seek “The great October Socialist Revolution gave  
birth to a new social system and was the beginning of the  
creation of a socialist state of workers and peasants. This new  
state, founded by the great Lenin, should have become a world  
center of constructive work in all areas of creativity”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 4)

“For the duration of the cult, Stalin was ceaselessly'called  
the greatest scientific genius of all times and all nations. In  
fact, of course, he was no genius, and his creative theoretical  
legacy is rather small.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 5)

“In that period, making political accusations was the easiest  
and most tempting method of vanquishing opponents who  
could not be subdued by the force of scientific argumentation.  
There were some who took that road, which often led not  
only to a rout but also to actual physical elimination of sci¬  
entific opponents.  
Unfounded political”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 6)

“It was exactly in this connection that certain leading scien¬  
tific schools, whose work later rightfully became the pride of  
Soviet science, were temporarily declared to be bourgeois,  
idealistic, and anti-Marxist.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 7)



“They went much  
farther than had their Lamarckist predecessors in accusations  
against Soviet geneticists, and denied all the basically useful  
theoretical and practical concepts of classical genetics that  
were recognized even by Lamarckian scientists in 1929-1932.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 9)

“his father had sown seeds of the winter variety  
Ukrainka, which wintered under the snow, and had obtained  
a yield of 24 centners per hectare. (In the first article on this  
experiment the yield was exaggerated as being over 30 cent¬  
ners.)”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 14)

“The then Commissar of Agriculture, Yakovlev, played a  
leading role in the creation of the department of vernalization”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)












“But it served as a base for sub¬  
sequent criticisms of AIPB, and of Vavilov as being incapable  
of solving the problem”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 19)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 19) The procumation was unrealistic and served to help the attack against vevlo



“The opposite side in the polemic was represented in 1936  
by the majority of leaders of the genetical, cytological, and  
breeding institutes of our country.1 Vavilov, at that time the  
world’s outstanding plant breeder, applied geneticist, and geog¬  
rapher, enjoying merited recognition and fame in many coun¬  
tries, was the factual head of the opposition to Lysenko’s  
genetical ideas. It should be noted, however, that Vavilov  
and the other scientists took a favorable view of certain other  
ideas then being worked out by Lysenko and his institute (for  
example, phasic development of plants, and summer planting  
of potatoes).2”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 21)

“The” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 21)

“Prezent and Lysenko unfortunately did not follow such a  
path of productive polemic. They rejected the gene theory  
on a priori, abstract considerations, ignoring the factual mater¬  
ial of genetics. They attempted to abolish genetics on the  
grounds that it was an allegedly formalistic, bourgeois, and  
metaphysical science, and to inaugurate their own new ge¬  
netics.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 22)

“In later years Lysenko reported other analogous experi¬  
ments. The question of reversible transformation of winter  
and spring forms will be examined later in greater detail. Here,  
it is the initial “historical” experiment from which the repudia¬  
tion of classical genetics started that is of interest.)”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 23)

“Our most prolonged experiments at this time are those transform¬  
ing the winter wheat Kooperatorka into a spring form”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 23)

“But the pot with these plants  
sown on March 3 was left not in a warm hothouse but in a cool  
one where the temperature from March 3 to the end of April was  
frequently no higher than 10-15° C. Only beginning with May was  
the temperature higher and, most importantly, never below 15° C.  
Since the Lutescens 329 variety was more of a winter type than  
Kooperatorka, both its plants lived until late fall and perished with¬  
out heading”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 24)

“An experiment  
without replicatioti is not a scientific experiment. The single  
seed could have been a hybrid, a mutant, or a contaminant.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 25)

“Lysenko considered that, if he could alter a winter into a  
spring form and then reverse the process, there are no im¬  
mutable genes for winter habit, and all depends on the envi¬  
ronment: hence there are no genes of any kind. But this  
analysis lacks logic”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 25)

“In this manner Lysenko formulated his basic genetical  
idea (the presence of some property of heredity distributed  
throughout the cell)”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 28)

“Promoters of such shaky and insecure trends usually seek  
support from any popular names, and frequently cite as  
authorities deceased and (obligatorily) native scientists.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29) Instance of Lyndon saying there work derives from someone who isn’t a genetisict and one who still supported the gene theory

“third, because the indetermin¬  
ate, undirected nature of mutation was contradictory to  
Lysenko’s principles of environmentally induced hereditary  
changes in a particular direction.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29)

“Nevertheless, the thesis that each individual gene mutates  
only once in tens of thousands of years was used by the oppo¬  
nents of genetics as a bugbear”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 31)

“in¬  
compatible with the dialectical materialism that asserts that  
everything in nature changes and develops”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 31)

“Lysenko, with his Kooperatorka experiments, has  
shown that, if one approaches a plant skillfully, knowing life and  
not merely the external traits of a plant, if one chooses methods  
of influence not as the geneticists do, “the stronger, the better,””  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 31)

“but selects methods consonant with the given stage of development  
of the organism, then in a brief period it is possible to alter the  
hereditary nature of the plant”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 32)

“reactions of glycolysis, oxidation, and phosphorylation are all  
the same in the whole living world”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 33)

“Muller, an American scientist and friend  
of Vavilov, came to work in the U.S.S.R. as a socialist sym¬  
pathizer.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 33)



“Hence it countered genetic theory with the old and repeatedly  
disproved principle of inheritance of acquired characters al¬  
ready formulated by Lamarc”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 35)

“Lysenko made the abstract assumption that there  
are some periods in the life history of a plant in which en¬  
vironment, by being “assimilated” into the plant, changes its  
heredity. At other times, he alleged, the heredity is conserva¬  
tive and unchangeable.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 36)

“Lysenko  
clearly pointed out that “in a general way, it is clear to all  
that external conditions play a colossal role in the endless  
process of formation of vegetable organisms. But, as far as  
I know, nobody yet has been able to prove experimentally  
what conditions in what developmental periods of plants are  
required to change the nature of subsequent generations in the  
desired directions.”15”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 36)

“Russia was an agrarian country with an exceptionally back¬  
ward agriculture.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 38)

“This was true despite the fact that many local ancient  
Russian and Ukrainian varieties of winter and hard wheats,  
flax, and other crops had acquired world fame, and covered  
millions of hectares in Canada, the United States, and else¬  
where.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 38)

“Their members investigated the agriculture  
and plant resources of 65 countries and brought to the Soviet  
Union over 150,000 plant varieties, forms and species—all of  
the plant-breeding wealth created by mankind in its centuries-  
old history. Thus the collection of the world’s domesticated  
plants was established.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 40)

“Creation of a system of pro¬  
ductive Soviet plant breeding 'would have been impossible  
'without this work. In his address to the 1936 session of the  
LAAAS, Vavilov described vividly and convincingly the  
theoretical and practical significance of this trend in the field  
of Soviet selection and plant breeding founded by him”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 41)

“By 1937 the best varieties of cereal crops had been produced  
by the standard genetical methods of mass selection and  
development of pure lines. At that time over 60 per cent of  
the land under cereal crops in our country was planted to  
those varietie”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 42)

“inbreeding of cross-fertilizers—rejected and  
later prohibited by Lysenkoites—led to a revolution in the pro¬  
duction of corn, and increased yields through use of hybrids  
by 20 to 30 per cent.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 42)

“Mutations, in particular those induced  
by X-ray, were widely studied and used. At the same time  
the struggle was begun against lethal and harmful mutations  
and hereditary diseases, which could be revealed and antici¬  
pated only by genetical methods. This enumeration could be  
continued at length.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 43)

“Lysenko and his group at that period  
showed only two sensational achievements: vernalization and  
summer planting of potatoes”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 43)

“they considered that useful traits of plants are  
not hereditarily transmitted but arise anew in every genera¬  
tion under the influence of the environment, new characteris¬  
tics, according to their hypothesis, could be produced by  
environmental influences and not from imported genetical  
material”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 44)

“the scientific discussion on genetics was  
transformed into a debate against the “enemies of the people”  
in the pages of the journal Yarovizatsya, the founder and  
chief editor of which was [[Lysenko]]”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 46)

“the Darwinian bases of the  
biology of development, in the Leningrad State University, was an¬  
nihilated.1”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 47)




“.. I repeat for clarity: Darwinists are for  
and not against genetics; Darwinists are not against genetics, but  
they are against the fascist distortion of genetics and fascist utiliza¬  
tion of genetics for political aims,”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 50)

“In  reality, fascism was afraid of the real scientific genetics: in  Hitler’s Germany a number of genetics institutes were closed,  
and outstanding German geneticists were forced to leave  their native land”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 50)



“In working on the collection the  
institute gave the country hundreds of literary monographs and  
systematic botanical descriptions instead of new varieties for wide¬  
spread production.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 53)

“Among the accomplices of the enemies of the people named  
in this article were such scientists as the academicians [[Vavilov]],  
M. M. Zavadovsky, and Konstantinov, who were charged  
with an inimical attitude toward [[Lysenko]]’s work”

“But you proceed from immutability of genes and of the  
nature of plants.””  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 59)

“Why do you speak of Darwin, and why do you not choose  
examples from Marx and Engels?  
vavilov: Darwin worked on evolution of species earlier. Engels  
and Marx held Darwin in high regard. Darwin is not all, but he  
is the greatest biologist, who proved the evolution of organisms.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 60)

“l: Everybody says that the potato came from America. I don’t  
believe this. Do you know what Lenin said?  
vavilov: . . . we know well that potatoes appeared in our countrv  
under Peter the First.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 61)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 62) Come back to this dialogue

“Marxism is the only science. Darwinism is only a part; the  
real theory of knowledge of the world was given by Marx, Engels,  
and Lenin. And when I hear discussion about Darwinism without  
mention of Marxism, it may seem, on the one side, that all is  
right, but on the other, it’s a horse of a different color”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 63)

“The proposals for introduction of hybrid corn in the  
U.S.S.R. were based on its success in the United States where  
its use had increased yields by 20 to 30 per cent on millions  
of acres”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 64)

“But this progressive practice met the  
sharp resistance of Lysenko, Prezent, Ol’shansky, and others,”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 64)

“and his low level of culture lead to a  
peculiar introduction of ideas that are close to outmoded scientific  
views (Lamarckism),”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 66)

“On his visits to AIPB in Leningrad, the president deliberately  
emphasizes, before meetings of the scientific workers, his cate¬  
gorical disagreements with the director”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 66)** Go Back to this 6 reasons

“This was the situation exploited by [[Lysenko]]

“Our affairs are in a bad way, even Andreev fears Lysenko.”  
This was justified: Lysenko had become Stalin’s favorite.34”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 67)

“In the evening the other members of the expedition re¬  
turned without Vavilov. He was taken so fast that his things  
were left in one of the cars.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 70)

“After Vavilov, his closest collaborators and friends were also  
arrested and later perished in prison”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 70)

“Vavilov himself noted Shundenko’s il¬  
literacy and disruptive role”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 71)

“Vavilov. He was found  
guilty on a number of points of Article 58: Belonging to a  
rightist conspiracy; spying for England; leadership of the  
Labor Peasant Party; sabotage in agriculture; links with white  
emigres; etc.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 72)

“Little is known so far of Vavilov’s last period of life, spent  
in the Saratov prison”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 73)

“At the end of 1942, Vavilov, who had mysteriously “dis¬  
appeared” from the world science scene, was elected a foreign  
member of the Royal Society of London.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 74)

“Vavilov file was urgently re¬  
called for study. But it was too late. Life was slowly ebbing  
from a body exhausted by malnutrition”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 74)

“In 1936—  
1937 the problems of hereditarily determined diseases were  
only at the stage of preliminary investigation and elucidation  
of hereditary patholog”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 78)








“It may be appropriate to give some examples of the  
methods whereby Vil’yams’ supporters attempted, in 1935—  
1937, to force nationwide acceptance of the grassland system,  
although it was never subjected to experimental tests before  
or after its adoption”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 87)

“In 1937 the grassland system reached the level of a state prob¬  
lem, and the first draft of a law to adopt it throughout the  
country was prepared”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 89)

“Vil’yams and Pryanishnikov schools. The latter  
insisted on the development of mineral fertilizers, one-year  
planting of clover without cereal grass admixture (thus im¬  
proving the nitrogen balance of the soil)”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 89)

“Vil’yams, on the other hand, proposed not to develop the  
fertilizer industry; to expand clover planting to two to three  
years running, and only in mixtures with timothy and other  
cereal grasses”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 90)

“How  
was he able to hypnotize the planning organs into accepting  
on faith his fantastic promises of 100 to 160 centners per  
hectare yields of wheat merely from decomposition of roots  
of perennial cereals?”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 91)

“Several months later the issue of sabotage in agricul¬  
tural chemistry was dredged up again by another Vil’yams  
follower, Lyashchenko”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 92)

“Vavilov, whose fate has already been recounted, was a  
student of Pryanishnikov’s, and they were very fond of each  
other”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 95)

“Vil’yams’ hypothesis greatly exag¬  
gerated the role of soil structure in the retention of moisture  
and similarly exaggerated the role of perennial grasses in the  
development of soil texture.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 96)

“Although Tulaikov perished in the fight against Vil’yams’  
system, Vil’yams apparently cannot be personally accused of  
his death”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 97)

“The immediate cause of the annihilation of Tulai-  
kov’s school was an article by Stoletov, “Against foreign  
theories in agronomy,” published in the central press on  
April ii, 1937.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 97)

“his pupils and followers took full advantage  
of the overblown cult of Vil’yams to secure for themselves  
dominant positions in many responsible posts. These men  
(Bushinsky, Chizhevsky, Dmitriev, Demidov, Avaev, and  
others), having contributed nothing either to science or to  
practice, lived off the exploitation of Vil’yams’ unmerited  
glory”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 98)


“On  
November 5, 1945, Lysenko first gave his paper, which denied  
the existence of intraspecific competition among plants and  
animals in nature”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 105)

“On reading the article, which he, himself, had originally  
asked for, Lysenko became enraged and categorically refused  
to print it in his journa”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 105)

“How to explain why bourgeois biology values so highly the “theory”  
of intraspecific competition? Because it must justify the fact that,  
in the capitalist society, the great majority of people, in a period  
of overproduction of material goods, lives poorly”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 107)

“These measures included the  
planting of winter varieties on unplowed stubble in Siberia,  
which caused severe damage to Siberian”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 111)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 112) Around 1948 young scientists doubted Lysenko, so he tried to consolidate his power.



“Difficulties were even  
experienced in citing foreign authors in articles and books.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)

“This was the situation  
exploited by Lysenko, who declared genetics to be a tool of  
reactionary American imperialism.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)

“Lysenko was able to reach Stalin with this absurd  
idea and to receive sanction for the organization, to the last  
detail, of the proposed rout.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)

“But there never was any voting, since Lysenko, heading off  
such an event, passed on to Stalin his own list, which had  
nothing in common with the one discussed by the scientific  
community”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 115)

“No elections  
were held for the next twelve years. Lysenko deliberately  
kept the vacancies open: he awaited an increase in the ranks  
of his supporters.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 116)

“But even this decree was not implemented. There were no  
elections until 1956, when Lysenko left the post of president,  
and then they were conducted by open balloting”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 116)

“Stalin’s participation in this affair was based on Lysenko’s  
misinforming him about the real situation in biology”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 118)

“Bourgeois genetics has become the fashionable “science” abroad,  
propagandizing “eugenics” and race politics. Weismannism-Mor¬  
ganism serves today in the arsenal of contemporary imperialism as  
a means for providing a “scientific base” for its reactionary poli¬  
tics.16”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 119)

“decreed the  
abolition of a number of laboratories pronounced hotbeds of re¬  
actionary Morganism (the laboratories of cytogenetics, botan¬  
ical cytology, phenogenesis, and others)”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 123)

“Within two days alone (August 23-24, 1948), Kaftanov  
issued a series of detailed orders published in pamphlet form  
and sent to every institution of higher learning. Order No.  
1208 (August 23, 1948), regarding universities, decreed (point  
2) the dismissal from Moscow University of those who ac¬  
tively fought against Michurinism, including the professor of  
Darwinism, Shmal’gauzen, the professor of developmental  
biology, M. M. Zavadovsky, the professor of plant physiology,  
Sabinin, the dean of the faculty, Yudintsev, and assistant pro¬  
fessors Alikhanyan, Zelikman, Berman, and Shapiro”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 124)

“For instance, there was an order to destroy all  
stocks of Drosophila”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 125)

“Thus, the Minister  
of Agriculture, Benediktov, issued an order (No. 1530, Octo¬  
ber 6, 1948) decreeing cessation of all genetic research in  
animal husbandry;”

“His assignment apparently had been to  
watch Zhukovsky’s school.”

“Art stores sold busts  
and bas-reliefs of Lysenko”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 131)

“Merrily play on, accordion,  
With my girl friend let me sing  
Of the eternal glory of Academician Lysenko.  
He walks the Michurin path  
With firm tread;  
He protects us from being duped  
by Mendelist-Morganists.”

with exaltation: “Aha! You came to relearn?””

“And they began by declaring reactionary  
and idealistic Einstein’s relativity theory (“reactionary Ein-  
steinism”), Bohr’s complementary principle, Pauling’s theory  
of resonance, and a number of other concepts that were land¬  
marks in science.”

“Immoderate  
praise and complete suppression of criticism were typical for  
only four years”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 136)

“The sympathies of  
scientists and of youth were with the Botanichesky Zhurnal.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“The  
Botanichesky Zhurnal rapidly became the most popular bio¬  
logical periodical, and its every issue was awaited with impa¬  
tience.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“The pseudoscientific work of Lepeshinskaya was de¬  
bunked in short order. By the end of 1955 more than three  
hundred scientists had signed a petition requesting Lysenko’s  
removal from the post of LAAAS president and the dismissal  
of Oparin as secretary of the Biological Section of the AS”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“Lysenko and  
his supporters once more succeeded in evoking administrative  
reprisals against their opponents. The editorial board of the  
Botanichesky Zhurnal was disbanded at the end of 1958 and  
reconstituted largely from Lysenko’s followers”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 138)

“This unique volume was also translated into  
languages of friendly socialist states, some of which, unfor¬  
tunately, adopted the Soviet “experience” of persecution of  
genetics”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 141)

“And here is what the pillars of Lysenkoism asserted in 1961-  
1963, when the mechanism of gene action on the molecular  
level had already been discovered, and biology had emerged  
at the forefront of the natural sciences:”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

“The assertion that  
there are in an organism some minute particles, genes, responsi¬  
ble for the transmission of hereditary traits is pure fantasy  
without any basis in science.””  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 147) Come back for false criticism of genetics

“With the aid of this doc¬  
trine, attempts are made to justify the exploitation of workers,  
colonialism, and racial discrimination”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 148)

“In general, in talking of the inauspicious contributions of  
Lysenko’s followers, to be fair, it must be pointed out that they  
formed a relatively small group of theoreticians.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 150)

“After all, it is said, Lysenko and his followers are in close touch with the practical application of research to problems of agriculture; they settle disputes in the field, and not with useless fruit flies. This is a widespread point of view and, unless it is analyzed, final judgment is not possible.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 151)support from any popular names, and frequently cite as authorities deceased and (obligatorily) native scientists.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29) Instance of Lyndon saying there work derives from someone who isn’t a genetisict and one who still supported the gene theory

“the scientific discussion on genetics was  
transformed into a debate against the “enemies of the people”  
in the pages of the journal Yarovizatsya, the founder and  
chief editor of which was [[Lysenko]]”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 46)

“the Darwinian bases of the  
biology of development, in the Leningrad State University, was an¬  
nihilated.1”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 47)

“Among the accomplices of the enemies of the people named in this article were such scientists as the academicians [[Vavilov]], M. M. Zavadovsky, and Konstantinov, who were charged with an inimical attitude toward [[Lysenko]]’s work”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 53)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 62) Come back to this dialogue


**“On his visits to AIPB in Leningrad, the president deliberately emphasizes, before meetings of the scientific workers, his categorical disagreements with the director”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 66)** Go Back to this 6 reasons

“This was the situation exploited by [[Lysenko]], who declared genetics to be a tool of reactionary American imperialism.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 147) Come back for false criticism of genetics

“With the aid of this doctrine, attempts are made to justify the exploitation of workers, colonialism, and racial discrimination”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 148)
















“The first article is by Semenov,1 and the second by Frolov.2  
The first analyzes the subjective-philosophical causes of the  
origin of false doctrines in natural science. The second dem¬  
onstrates how such false doctrines, under the conditions of  
the personality cult, can apparently be amalgamated with a  
dominant, dogmatic philosophy and thus receive the strongest  
support from influential ideological circles.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 244)

“To create a false doctrine, all that may be required  
is a fanatical person who has faith in the products of his own  
fantasy and who assumes the function of an infallible, scien¬  
tific prophet”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 246)

“There was an erroneous tendency to classify sciences as  
bourgeois on the one hand, and proletarian or socialist on the  
other. T”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 247)

“Constant difficulties and mistaken policies occurred in the  
country’s agricultural production. For many years, beginning  
with the headlong collectivization and massive repressions  
against the more prosperous peasants, and ending with Khru¬  
shchev’s decrees which limited the possibilities of individual  
livestock rearing, agricultural policy was based not so much  
on concern for an all-around development of agricultural pro¬  
duction and an increase in soil productivity, but rather on  
achieving maximum agricultural output at minimum budgetary  
cost.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 248)

“made possible popular support for one or another scientific  
trend selected by the political leadership, and complete sup¬  
pression of the opposition”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 249)

“Criticism by  
other papers of any articles published in Pravda is practically  
impossible”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 249)

“Criticism of Lysenko in the three active periods of the con¬  
troversy (1935-1938, 1946-1947, 1953-1958) was to be found  
only in specialized scientific journals. Several times, however,  
and for long periods, strict censorship bans on all criticism of  
Lysenko and Michurinist biology extended to all publications.  
Between 1948 and 1952, even any positive descriptions of ge-  
netical experiments were forbidden by the censorship. In  
1958-1964, only direct criticism of Lysenko was prohibited,  
and papers on experimental genetics were published without  
great difficulty, but only in a small number of scientific jour¬  
nals.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 250)

“An important factor in the prolonged domination of Ly-  
senkoism was the protracted practical isolation of Soviet scien¬  
tists and the Soviet intelligentsia from world science, foreign  
scientific institutions, and colleagues abroad”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 250)

“Beginning with  
1933-1934, possibilities for Soviet scientists to participate in in¬  
ternational conferences, congresses, and symposia abroad be¬  
came sharply limited”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 250)

“prevailing in the U.S.S.R., the periodic,  
prolonged capture of key administrative posts (the LAAAS  
praesidium, the Ministry of Agriculture, the agricultural sec¬  
tion of the CC, the degree-awarding commission, the Min¬  
istry of Education, etc.) by Lysenkoites secured for them full  
control over virtually all biological and agricultural science  
and education”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 252)

“Since October, 1964, the popular support which  
Lysenko and his followers received from state and political  
authorities disappeared, and this fact is important”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 253)
