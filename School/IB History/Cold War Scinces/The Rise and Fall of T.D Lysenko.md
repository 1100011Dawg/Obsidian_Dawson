[^1]:  “author’s three points of view: as  historian; as a witness to the events; and as an active participant  in the last stages of Lysenkoism, which he helped to topple.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 9)

“This book consists of three parts. The first two  
were written in 1961-1962 and augmented in 1963-1964; the  
third was written in 1966-1967”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 22)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 10) Here is one scientist who was a Darwinist that was slandered as well as his students

“Promoters of such shaky and insecure trends usually seek support from any popular names, and frequently cite as authorities deceased and (obligatorily) native scientists.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29) Instance of Lyndon saying there work derives from someone who isn’t a genetisict and one who still supported the gene theory

“the scientific discussion on genetics was  
transformed into a debate against the “enemies of the people”  
in the pages of the journal Yarovizatsya, the founder and  
chief editor of which was Lysenko”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 46)

“the Darwinian bases of the  
biology of development, in the Leningrad State University, was an¬  
nihilated.1”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 47)

“Among the accomplices of the enemies of the people named in this article were such scientists as the academicians Vavilov, M. M. Zavadovsky, and Konstantinov, who were charged with an inimical attitude toward Lysenko’s work”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 53)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 62) Come back to this dialogue


**“On his visits to AIPB in Leningrad, the president deliberately emphasizes, before meetings of the scientific workers, his categorical disagreements with the director”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 66)** Go Back to this 6 reasons

“This was the situation exploited by Lysenko, who declared genetics to be a tool of reactionary American imperialism.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)

“Lysenko exclaims  with exaltation: “Aha! You came to relearn?”” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 132)

“biology by the theory of neo-Lamarckism, which is sup¬  
planting neo-Darwinism.”37”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 136)

“Immoderate  
praise and complete suppression of criticism were typical for  
only four years”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 136)

“The sympathies of  
scientists and of youth were with the Botanichesky Zhurnal.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“The  
Botanichesky Zhurnal rapidly became the most popular bio¬  
logical periodical, and its every issue was awaited with impa¬  
tience.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“The pseudoscientific work of Lepeshinskaya was de¬  
bunked in short order. By the end of 1955 more than three  
hundred scientists had signed a petition requesting Lysenko’s  
removal from the post of LAAAS president and the dismissal  
of Oparin as secretary of the Biological Section of the AS”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 137)

“Lysenko and  
his supporters once more succeeded in evoking administrative  
reprisals against their opponents. The editorial board of the  
Botanichesky Zhurnal was disbanded at the end of 1958 and  
reconstituted largely from Lysenko’s followers”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 138)

“This unique volume was also translated into  
languages of friendly socialist states, some of which, unfor¬  
tunately, adopted the Soviet “experience” of persecution of  
genetics”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 141)

“And here is what the pillars of Lysenkoism asserted in 1961-  
1963, when the mechanism of gene action on the molecular  
level had already been discovered, and biology had emerged  
at the forefront of the natural sciences:”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

“The assertion that  
there are in an organism some minute particles, genes, responsi¬  
ble for the transmission of hereditary traits is pure fantasy  
without any basis in science.””  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 147) Come back for false criticism of genetics

“With the aid of this doc¬  
trine, attempts are made to justify the exploitation of workers,  
colonialism, and racial discrimination”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 148)

“In general, in talking of the inauspicious contributions of  
Lysenko’s followers, to be fair, it must be pointed out that they  
formed a relatively small group of theoreticians.”  
(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 150)

“After all, it is said, Lysenko and his followers are in close touch with the practical application of research to problems of agriculture; they settle disputes in the field, and not with useless fruit flies. This is a widespread point of view and, unless it is analyzed, final judgment is not possible.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 151)
