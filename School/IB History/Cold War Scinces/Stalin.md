[^1]:“For the duration of the cult, Stalin was ceaselessly'called  the greatest scientific genius of all times and all nations. In  fact, of course, he was no genius, and his creative theoretical  legacy is rather small.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 5)

[^2]:“Our affairs are in a bad way, even Andreev fears Lysenko.”  This was justified: Lysenko had become Stalin’s favorite.34”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 67)

[^3]:“Lysenko was able to reach Stalin with this absurd  idea and to receive sanction for the organization, to the last  detail, of the proposed rout.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)

[^4]:“But there never was any voting, since Lysenko, heading off  such an event, passed on to Stalin his own list, which had  nothing in common with the one discussed by the scientific  community”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 115)
