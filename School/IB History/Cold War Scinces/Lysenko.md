#### Lysenko Early period
 - Denied all genetic concepts, taking it even farther than their Lamarkist predecessors[^7]
 - Farther had sown seeds of winter variety in Ukrainka[^8]
 - helped with starting [[Vernalization]] by Yakovlev[^10]

#### Lysenko General
- One of his most important "discoveries" was [[Vernalization]][^1]. He was connected with [[Prezent]][^2] 
	- “In fact, comrades, while vernalization created by Soviet reality  could in a relatively short period of some four to five years be¬  come a whole branch of science, could fight off all the attacks of  the class enemy”[^5] This greatly pleased [[Stalin]][^6]
- Tried to abolish genetics on the basis that it was a bourgeois science and non dialectic materialism[^11][^15]
- Based on his Vernalization experiments he formulated the idea of presence of some property of heredity distributed throughout the cell)[^12]

- He was also heavily criticized for his scientific methods[^3]
	- “Lysenko, in 1931 —1934, advanced the so-called theory of phasic development of plants”  [^4]
	- Thought potatoes came from russia because of Lenin[^10]
	- Was against intraspefifc competition[^20]
		>“How to explain why bourgeois biology values so highly the “theory”  of intraspecific competition? Because it must justify the fact that,  in the capitalist society, the great majority of people, in a period  of overproduction of material goods, lives poorly” [^21]
#### Contra genetics:
 - Undirected nature of mutation contradicted Lysenko[^13]
 - The rate of mutation was used contra genetics[^14]
 - Lysenko thought there was a period during a organism life where it assimilates changes from the environment[^16][^17]
 - Thought new useful traits could only result of environmental influence[^18]
 - Put Marxism above Science:
	 > “Marxism is the only science. Darwinism is only a part; the real theory of knowledge of the world was given by Marx, Engels, and Lenin. And when I hear discussion about Darwinism without mention of Marxism, it may seem, on the one side, that all is  right, but on the other, it’s a horse of a different color”  [^19]
 - Says genetics supports eugenics and Weismannism-Morganism with it's Bourgeois reactionary science.
	 - 

#### Late years
 - Young scientists doubted him in 1948 so he tried to consolidate power[^22]
	 - Around 1948 there were difficulties citing foriegn authors due to them being "reactionary'[^23]

[^2]:“Prezent  and Lysenko enlivened the genetics debate in 1935 only after  their “creative partnership” was established.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 9)

[^3]:“Criticism of its  positions was actually banned in the press and was mercilessly  eradicated by all means of press control. By 1966 Lysenkoism,  as such, had already disappeared from Soviet science, not having survived even one year of open discussion.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)

[^6]:“This speech of Lysenko greatly pleased Stalin who, at its  end, exclaimed: “Bravo, comrade Lysenko, bravo!””  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 17)

[^7]:“They went much  farther than had their Lamarckism predecessors in accusations  against Soviet geneticists, and denied all the basically useful  theoretical and practical concepts of classical genetics that  were recognized even by Lamarckian scientists in 1929-1932.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 9)

[^8]:“his father had sown seeds of the winter variety Ukrainka, which wintered under the snow, and had obtained a yield of 24 centners per hectare. (In the first article on this experiment the yield was exaggerated as being over 30 centners.)” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 14)

[^9]:“l: Everybody says that the potato came from America. I don’t believe this. Do you know what Lenin said? vavilov: . . . we know well that potatoes appeared in our country under Peter the First.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 61)

[^10]:“The then Commissar of Agriculture, Yakovlev, played a leading role in the creation of the department of vernalization” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)

[^11]:“Prezent and Lysenko unfortunately did not follow such a  path of productive polemic. They rejected the gene theory  on a priori, abstract considerations, ignoring the factual material of genetics. They attempted to abolish genetics on the  grounds that it was an allegedly formalistic, bourgeois, and  metaphysical science, and to inaugurate their own new genetics.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 22)

[^12]:“In this manner Lysenko formulated his basic genetical  idea (the presence of some property of heredity distributed  throughout the cell)” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 28)

[^13]:“third, because the indeterminate, undirected nature of mutation was contradictory to Lysenko’s principles of environmentally induced hereditary changes in a particular direction.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 29)

[^14]:“Nevertheless, the thesis that each individual gene mutates only once in tens of thousands of years was used by the opponents of genetics as a bugbear” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 31)

[^15]:“incompatible with the dialectical materialism that asserts that everything in nature changes and develops”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 31)

[^16]:“Lysenko made the abstract assumption that there  are some periods in the life history of a plant in which environment, by being “assimilated” into the plant, changes its heredity. At other times, he alleged, the heredity is conservative and unchangeable.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 36)
[^17]:“Lysenko clearly pointed out that “in a general way, it is clear to all that external conditions play a colossal role in the endless process of formation of vegetable organisms. But, as far as I know, nobody yet has been able to prove experimentally what conditions in what developmental periods of plants are required to change the nature of subsequent generations in the desired directions.”15”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 36)

[^18]:“they considered that useful traits of plants are not hereditarily transmitted but arise anew in every generation under the influence of the environment, new characteristics, according to their hypothesis, could be produced by environmental influences and not from imported genetical material” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 44)

[^19]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 63)

[^20]:“On  November 5, 1945, Lysenko first gave his paper, which denied  the existence of intraspecific competition among plants and  animals in nature”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 105)

[^21]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 107)

[^22]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 112) Around 1948 young scientists doubted Lysenko, so he tried to consolidate his power.

[^23]:“Difficulties were even  experienced in citing foreign authors in articles and books.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 114)

[^24]:“Bourgeois genetics has become the fashionable “science” abroad,  propagandizing “eugenics” and race politics. Weismannism-Morganism serves today in the arsenal of contemporary imperialism as a means for providing a “scientific base” for its reactionary politics.16” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 119)

[^25]:“decreed the  abolition of a number of laboratories pronounced hotbeds of reactionary Morganism (the laboratories of cytogenetics, botanical cytology, phenogenesis, and others)” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 123)
