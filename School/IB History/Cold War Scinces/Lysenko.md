#### Lysenko Early period
 - Denied all genetic concepts, taking it even farther than their Lamarkist predecessors[

- One of his most important "discoveries" was [[vernalization]][^1]. He was connected with [[Prezent]][^2] 
	- “In fact, comrades, while vernalization created by Soviet reality  could in a relatively short period of some four to five years be¬  come a whole branch of science, could fight off all the attacks of  the class enemy”[^5] This greatly pleased [[Stalin]][^6]

- He was also heavily criticized for his scientific methods[^3]
	- “Lysenko, in 1931 —1934, advanced the so-called theory of phasic development of plants”  [^4]
	- 


[^1]:“Lysenko acquired a really broad reputation, however, with  his “discovery” of so-called vernalization (yarovization), an agronomic practice whereby winter crops are obtained rfm  summer planting”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 12)

[^2]:“Prezent  and Lysenko enlivened the genetics debate in 1935 only after  their “creative partnership” was established.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 9)

[^3]:“Criticism of its  positions was actually banned in the press and was mercilessly  eradicated by all means of press control. By 1966 Lysenkoism,  as such, had already disappeared from Soviet science, not having survived even one year of open discussion.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)

[^4]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)

[^5]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 16)

[^6]:“This speech of Lysenko greatly pleased Stalin who, at its  end, exclaimed: “Bravo, comrade Lysenko, bravo!””  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 17)

[^7]:“They went much  farther than had their Lamarckist predecessors in accusations  against Soviet geneticists, and denied all the basically useful  
theoretical and practical concepts of classical genetics that  
were recognized even by Lamarckian scientists in 1929-1932.”
