#### General
 - Formed a small group[^10]
 - Were "close to the ground" on research[^11]
#### Effects:
 - Dismissed professors against Michurinism.[^1]
	 - Such as Shmal’gauzen, Zavadovsky, Yudintsev, Alikhanyan, Zelikman, Berman, and Shapiro
 - Destroed stock of Drosophila[^2]
 - Destroyed books about genetics in TAA library[^3]
 - Order (No. 1530, October 6, 1948), Minister of Agriculture called cessation of genetic research.[^4]
 - When the mechanism of gene action had been discovered[^8] Lysenkoists said:
	 > “The assertion that there are in an organism some minute particles, genes, responsible for the transmission of hereditary traits is pure fantasy  without any basis in science.””[^9]
 - Lysenko promoted to mix superphosphate with lime before applying it to the soil, witch is absorbed because it transforms superphosphate to insolbe tricalcium.[^12]
 - Many of their experiments lacked a control[^13]
 - Who could not remember branched wheat[^14]
	 - Had half the protein was susceptible to disease and didn't branch under normal growing conditions[^15]
#### Secondary Effects
 - Cybernetics remained underground until 1955[^5]
 - Declared Einstein relativity theory, Bohr complementary principle and Pauling theory of resonance were declared reactionary[^6]
 - Science discredited from the Untied States[^7]

Footnotes:

[^1]:“Within two days alone (August 23-24, 1948), Kaftanov  issued a series of detailed orders published in pamphlet form  and sent to every institution of higher learning. Order No.  1208 (August 23, 1948), regarding universities, decreed (point 2) the dismissal from Moscow University of those who actively fought against Michurinism, including the professor of  Darwinism, Shmal’gauzen, the professor of developmental  biology, M. M. Zavadovsky, the professor of plant physiology,  Sabinin, the dean of the faculty, Yudintsev, and assistant professors Alikhanyan, Zelikman, Berman, and Shapiro”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 124)

[^2]:“For instance, there was an order to destroy all  stocks of Drosophila”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 125)

[^3]:"The TAA library destroyed all genetics textbooks, the books of Shmal’gauzen, and much other literature."(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 125)

[^4]:“Thus, the Minister  of Agriculture, Benediktov, issued an order (No. 1530, October 6, 1948) decreeing cessation of all genetic research in  animal husbandry;” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 126)

[^5]:“Cybernetics was likewise  declared reactionary, and remained underground until 1955.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^6]:“And they began by declaring reactionary and idealistic Einstein’s relativity theory (“reactionary Einsteinism”), Bohr’s complementary principle, Pauling’s theory of resonance, and a number of other concepts that were landmarks in science.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^7]:“discredited merely on the grounds that they had been developed in the United States”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^8]:“And here is what the pillars of Lysenkoism asserted in 1961-1963, when the mechanism of gene action on the molecular level had already been discovered, and biology had emerged at the forefront of the natural sciences:”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

[^9]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

[^10]:“In general, in talking of the inauspicious contributions of  [[Lysenko]]’s followers, to be fair, it must be pointed out that they  formed a relatively small group of theoreticians.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 150)

[^11]:“After all, it is said, [[Lysenko]] and his followers are in close touch with the practical application of research to problems of agriculture; they settle disputes in the field, and not with useless fruit flies. This is a widespread point of view and, unless it is analyzed, final judgment is not possible.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 151)

[^12]:“Lysenko for  many years proposed to mix superphosphate with lime before applying it to the soil. This procedure is absurd because it transforms superphosphate into an insoluble form, tricalcium phosphate”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 172)

[^13]: “We were shown how well the organic-mineral mixtures work. Very well, but it would be good to see a neighboring plot where other methods of fertilizing were used for comparison” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 174 (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 174) They do science with fertilization very poorly here

[^14]:“Who does not remember the preliminary advertising of branched wheat” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 176)

[^15]:“The branched wheat would not branch under ordinary growing conditions, its spikes were smaller than those of standard varieties, and its yield half as large. The miraculous wheat was susceptible to every disease, and its grain contained half the protein found in standard varieties.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 177)
