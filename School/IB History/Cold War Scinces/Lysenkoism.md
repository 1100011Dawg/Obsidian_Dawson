#### General
 - Formed a small group[^10]
#### Effects:
 - Dismissed professors against Michurinism.[^1]
	 - Such as Shmal’gauzen, Zavadovsky, Yudintsev, Alikhanyan, Zelikman, Berman, and Shapiro
 - Destroed stock of Drosophila[^2]
 - Destroyed books about genetics in TAA library[^3]
 - Order (No. 1530, October 6, 1948), Minister of Agriculture called cessation of genetic research.[^4]
 - When the mechanism of geneaction had been discoved[] Lysenkoists said:
	 > “The assertion that there are in an organism some minute particles, genes, responsible for the transmission of hereditary traits is pure fantasy  without any basis in science.””[^9]
#### Secondary Effects
 - Cybernetics remained underground until 1955[^5]
 - Declared Einstein relativity theory, Bohr complementary principle and Pauling theory of resonance were declared reactionary[^6]
 - Science discredited from the Untied States[^7]

[^1]:“Within two days alone (August 23-24, 1948), Kaftanov  issued a series of detailed orders published in pamphlet form  and sent to every institution of higher learning. Order No.  1208 (August 23, 1948), regarding universities, decreed (point 2) the dismissal from Moscow University of those who actively fought against Michurinism, including the professor of  Darwinism, Shmal’gauzen, the professor of developmental  biology, M. M. Zavadovsky, the professor of plant physiology,  Sabinin, the dean of the faculty, Yudintsev, and assistant professors Alikhanyan, Zelikman, Berman, and Shapiro”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 124)

[^2]:“For instance, there was an order to destroy all  stocks of Drosophila”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 125)

[^3]:"The TAA library destroyed all genetics textbooks, the books of Shmal’gauzen, and much other literature."(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 125)

[^4]:“Thus, the Minister  of Agriculture, Benediktov, issued an order (No. 1530, October 6, 1948) decreeing cessation of all genetic research in  animal husbandry;” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 126)

[^5]:“Cybernetics was likewise  declared reactionary, and remained underground until 1955.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^6]:“And they began by declaring reactionary and idealistic Einstein’s relativity theory (“reactionary Einsteinism”), Bohr’s complementary principle, Pauling’s theory of resonance, and a number of other concepts that were landmarks in science.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^7]:“discredited merely on the grounds that they had been developed in the United States”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^8]:“And here is what the pillars of Lysenkoism asserted in 1961-1963, when the mechanism of gene action on the molecular level had already been discovered, and biology had emerged at the forefront of the natural sciences:”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

[^10]:“In general, in talking of the inauspicious contributions of  Lysenko’s followers, to be fair, it must be pointed out that they  formed a relatively small group of theoreticians.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 150)
