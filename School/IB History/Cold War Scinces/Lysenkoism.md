#### General
 - Formed a small group[^10]
 - Were "close to the ground" on research[^11]
#### Effects:
 - Dismissed professors against Michurinism.[^1]
	 - Such as Shmal’gauzen, Zavadovsky, Yudintsev, Alikhanyan, Zelikman, Berman, and Shapiro
 - Destroed stock of Drosophila[^2]
 - Destroyed books about genetics in TAA library[^3]
 - Order (No. 1530, October 6, 1948), Minister of Agriculture called cessation of genetic research.[^4]
 - When the mechanism of gene action had been discovered[^8] Lysenkoists said:
	 > “The assertion that there are in an organism some minute particles, genes, responsible for the transmission of hereditary traits is pure fantasy  without any basis in science.””[^9]
	 
 - Lysenko promoted to mix superphosphate with lime before applying it to the soil, witch is absorbed because it transforms superphosphate to insolbe tricalcium.[^12]
 - Many of their experiments lacked a control[^13]
 - Who could not remember branched wheat[^14]
	 - Had half the protein was susceptible to disease and didn't branch under normal growing conditions[^15]
 - Went against the hormonal stimulation of superovulation in sheep[^16] and the english manged to use this successfully[^17].
 - Went against Hybrid corn from inbred lines[^18]
	 - America soon had 100% hybrid corn[^19]
	 - Around 30-50 billion is the loss of corn from this 20 year campaign.[^20]
 - Order 41 forced all institutions to follow Lepeshinskaya[^21]
 - Promoted ¨Soda Baths¨[^22]
 - Suggested plow depth of 1 meter instead of around 20cm.[^23]
	 - Yielded no crops???[^24]
 - Greben(the leader of zootechnical wing of Lysenkoism) acquired ¨dead souls¨[^25]
	 - One such was Ivanov which he repainted as a Lysenkoist[^26]
#### Secondary Effects
 - Cybernetics remained underground until 1955[^5]
 - Declared Einstein relativity theory, Bohr complementary principle and Pauling theory of resonance were declared reactionary[^6]
 - Science discredited from the Untied States[^7]
 - Still millions of Students learn this[^27]

#### Ending
 - The AS institute under Lysenko finally fell under review[^28]
	 - Prolonged by government support meeting was cancled[^29]
	 - wanted the eventual meeting to support his cause[^30]
 - 1963 no longer had supported, the academy of academic sciences was rebuilding[^31]
 - two weeks before the plenary session, the lysenkoists got the CC  ideological commission to remove a popular scientific magazine against them[^32]
 - Lebedex condemned Morganism and demanded it's banning from curricula, and criticized Lobashev's text [^33]
 - Political support dissipated 1964[^44]
#### The why
 - Semenov and Frolov determent how false doctrines originate from philosophies and personality cults, respectively[^34]
	 - To create a personality cult, one must act like a religious prophet, being fanatically and believing in his doctrine[^35]
 - Tendence to discredit other sciences as bourgeois[^36]
 - The U.S.S.R long neglected agriculture by implementing cost cutting measures rather than trying to optimize for best performance[^37]
 - If politicians favored one scientific theory over another, that other could be completely suppressed.[^38]
 - Pravda couldn't be criticized[^39]
 - From 1948-1952 even positive descriptions of genetics were criticized while 1958-1964 only direct criticism was censured.[^40]
 - The isolation from other Scientists contributed[^41]
	 - Started around 1933-1934[^42]
 - Lysenkoist secured high up positions:the LAAAS praesidium, the Ministry of Agriculture, the agricultural section of the CC, the degree awarding commission, the Ministry of Education[^43]

##### Footnotes
[^1]:“Within two days alone (August 23-24, 1948), Kaftanov  issued a series of detailed orders published in pamphlet form  and sent to every institution of higher learning. Order No.  1208 (August 23, 1948), regarding universities, decreed (point 2) the dismissal from Moscow University of those who actively fought against Michurinism, including the professor of  Darwinism, Shmal’gauzen, the professor of developmental  biology, M. M. Zavadovsky, the professor of plant physiology,  Sabinin, the dean of the faculty, Yudintsev, and assistant professors Alikhanyan, Zelikman, Berman, and Shapiro”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 124)

[^2]:“For instance, there was an order to destroy all  stocks of Drosophila”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 125)

[^3]:"The TAA library destroyed all genetics textbooks, the books of Shmal’gauzen, and much other literature."(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 125)

[^4]:“Thus, the Minister  of Agriculture, Benediktov, issued an order (No. 1530, October 6, 1948) decreeing cessation of all genetic research in  animal husbandry;” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 126)

[^5]:“Cybernetics was likewise  declared reactionary, and remained underground until 1955.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^6]:“And they began by declaring reactionary and idealistic Einstein’s relativity theory (“reactionary Einsteinism”), Bohr’s complementary principle, Pauling’s theory of resonance, and a number of other concepts that were landmarks in science.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^7]:“discredited merely on the grounds that they had been developed in the United States”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 133)

[^8]:“And here is what the pillars of Lysenkoism asserted in 1961-1963, when the mechanism of gene action on the molecular level had already been discovered, and biology had emerged at the forefront of the natural sciences:”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

[^9]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 146)

[^10]:“In general, in talking of the inauspicious contributions of  [[Lysenko]]’s followers, to be fair, it must be pointed out that they  formed a relatively small group of theoreticians.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 150)

[^11]:“After all, it is said, [[Lysenko]] and his followers are in close touch with the practical application of research to problems of agriculture; they settle disputes in the field, and not with useless fruit flies. This is a widespread point of view and, unless it is analyzed, final judgment is not possible.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 151)

[^12]:“Lysenko for  many years proposed to mix superphosphate with lime before applying it to the soil. This procedure is absurd because it transforms superphosphate into an insoluble form, tricalcium phosphate”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 172)

[^13]: “We were shown how well the organic-mineral mixtures work. Very well, but it would be good to see a neighboring plot where other methods of fertilizing were used for comparison” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 174 (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 174) They do science with fertilization very poorly here

[^14]:“Who does not remember the preliminary advertising of branched wheat” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 176)

[^15]:“The branched wheat would not branch under ordinary growing conditions, its spikes were smaller than those of standard varieties, and its yield half as large. The miraculous wheat was susceptible to every disease, and its grain contained half the protein found in standard varieties.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 177)

[^16]:“hormonal stimulation of superovulation in sheep and other species had been developed by the Morganist M. M. Zavadovsky” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 178)

[^17]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 178) Was successfully used by the English

[^18]:“Lysenko and Iris associates have long boasted of their struggle for many years against adoption in the U.S.S.R. of hybrid corn derived from crosses between inbred lines”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 179)

[^19]:“Three  or four years later, 100 per cent of the corn grown in the United States was of hybrid origin.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 180)

[^20]:“Thirty to fifty  billion kilograms of corn is the minimum loss sustained bv our country from the twenty-year anti-inbreeding campaign.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 181)

[^21]:“U.S.S.R. Minister of Higher Education, Stoletov, issued a special order41 which obliged all institutions of higher learning to believe Lepeshinskaya’s teaching” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 182)

[^22]:“This discovery was the famous “soda baths.””  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 183)

[^23]:“Bushinsky. He suggested that land should be plowed not to a depth of 20 centimeters, as is usually done, but of a meter” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 183)

[^24]:“This treatment yielded no  crops;”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 183)

[^25]:“Greben’, the leader of the zootechnical wing of Lysenkoism. He used the technique of Gogol’s hero Chichikov in acquiring “dead souls.” One such dead soul was the great Soviet animal husbandman, M. F. Ivanov” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 191)

[^26]:“Ivanov was thus repainted into a Lysenkoite”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 191)

[^27]:“In  secondary schools, millions of children still learned, from the stereotyped text on Darwinism by Veselov, that Morganist genetics is unproductive and reactionary, that it was begotten of the bourgeoisie, that acquired characters are inherited, and so forth.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 193)

[^28]:“The AS Institute of Genetics,  headed by Lysenko, fell within the bounds of such review.  At the end of June, for the first time in twenty years, the  Institute was visited by a group of scientists with a mandate  to examine, investigate, and report its finding”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 198)

[^29]:“But, on the evening of July 12, all members of the  commission were notified by telephone that the last meeting  had been canceled and the commission dissolved”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 199)

[^30]:“Ol’shansky.5 He obviously wanted  to have the session approach the 1948 one in significance and,  under cover of the decree, he demonstrated in his report the  triumph of Michurinist biology over the reactionary Morganism-Mendelism”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 202)

[^31]:“Furthermore, by 1963 Lysenkoism no longer had support in medicine, and the Academy of Medical Sciences was  undertaking decisive steps for the rebirth of medical genetics”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 208)

[^32]:“Two weeks before the plenary session, all of the  issue was removed from circulation at the order of the CC  ideological commission, barely two to three days after it had been consigned to the distributing agency. The CC agricultural secretary, Polyakov, who always complied with all Lysenkoite requests,” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 208)


[^33]:“Lebedev was then given the floor for purposes of condemning Morganism-Mendelism. He demanded the banning of Morganism from curricula and severely criticized Lobashev’s textbook of genetics”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 213)

[^34]:“The first article is by Semenov,1 and the second by Frolov.2  The first analyzes the subjective-philosophical causes of the  origin of false doctrines in natural science. The second demonstrates how such false doctrines, under the conditions of the personality cult, can apparently be amalgamated with a dominant, dogmatic philosophy and thus receive the strongest support from influential ideological circles.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 244)

[^35]:“To create a false doctrine, all that may be required  is a fanatical person who has faith in the products of his own fantasy and who assumes the function of an infallible, scientific prophet”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 246)

[^36]:“There was an erroneous tendency to classify sciences as bourgeois on the one hand, and proletarian or socialist on the other. T” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 247)

[^37]:“Constant difficulties and mistaken policies occurred in the country’s agricultural production. For many years, beginning with the headlong collectivization and massive repressions against the more prosperous peasants, and ending with Khrushchev’s decrees which limited the possibilities of individual livestock rearing, agricultural policy was based not so much on concern for an all-around development of agricultural production and an increase in soil productivity, but rather on achieving maximum agricultural output at minimum budgetary cost.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 248)

[^38]:“made possible popular support for one or another scientific trend selected by the political leadership, and complete suppression of the opposition” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 249)

[^39]:“Criticism by other papers of any articles published in Pravda is practically impossible” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 249)

[^40]:“Criticism of Lysenko in the three active periods of the controversy (1935-1938, 1946-1947, 1953-1958) was to be found only in specialized scientific journals. Several times, however, and for long periods, strict censorship bans on all criticism of Lysenko and Michurinist biology extended to all publications. Between 1948 and 1952, even any positive descriptions of genetical experiments were forbidden by the censorship. In 1958-1964, only direct criticism of Lysenko was prohibited, and papers on experimental genetics were published without great difficulty, but only in a small number of scientific journals.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 250)

[^41]:“An important factor in the prolonged domination of Lysenkoism was the protracted practical isolation of Soviet scientists and the Soviet intelligentsia from world science, foreign scientific institutions, and colleagues abroad” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 250)

[^42]:“Beginning with 1933-1934, possibilities for Soviet scientists to participate in international conferences, congresses, and symposia abroad became sharply limited” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 250)

[^43]:“prevailing in the U.S.S.R., the periodic, prolonged capture of key administrative posts (the LAAAS praesidium, the Ministry of Agriculture, the agricultural section of the CC, the degree-awarding commission, the Ministry of Education, etc.) by Lysenkoites secured for them full control over virtually all biological and agricultural science and education” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 252)

[^43]:“Since October, 1964, the popular support which Lysenko and his followers received from state and political authorities disappeared, and this fact is important” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 253)
