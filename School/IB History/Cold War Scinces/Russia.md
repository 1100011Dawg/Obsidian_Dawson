#### Agriculture
 - Had backward agriculture[^1]
 - But had good winter varieties of wheat and flax[^2]
 - Best crops were made by standard genetical methods(over 60% of crops)[^3]
 - Inbreeding of cross fertilizers lead to improvements of 20-30% rejected by Lysenko[^4]

[^2]:“This was true despite the fact that many local ancient  Russian and Ukrainian varieties of winter and hard wheats,  flax, and other crops had acquired world fame, and covered  millions of hectares in Canada, the United States, and elsewhere.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 38)

[^3]:“By 1937 the best varieties of cereal crops had been produced  by the standard genetical methods of mass selection and  development of pure lines. At that time over 60 per cent of  the land under cereal crops in our country was planted to  those varieties”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 42)
