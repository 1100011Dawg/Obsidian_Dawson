#### Agriculture
 - Had backward agriculture[^1]
 - But had good winter varieties of wheat and flax[^2]
 - Best crops were made by standard genetical methods(over 60% of crops)[^3]
 - Inbreeding of cross fertilizers lead to improvements of 20-30% rejected by Lysenko[^4]
	 - Met resiste
 - Used Mutations by X-ray?[^5]


Footnotes:

[^1]:“Russia was an agrarian country with an exceptionally backward agriculture.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 38)

[^2]:“This was true despite the fact that many local ancient  Russian and Ukrainian varieties of winter and hard wheats,  flax, and other crops had acquired world fame, and covered  millions of hectares in Canada, the United States, and elsewhere.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 38)

[^3]:“By 1937 the best varieties of cereal crops had been produced  by the standard genetical methods of mass selection and  development of pure lines. At that time over 60 per cent of  the land under cereal crops in our country was planted to  those varieties”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 42)

[^4]:“inbreeding of cross-fertilizers—rejected and later prohibited by Lysenkoites—led to a revolution in the production of corn, and increased yields through use of hybrids by 20 to 30 per cent.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 42) Might be refering to this instead:"hybrid corn in the  U.S.S.R. were based on its success in the United States where its use had increased yields by 20 to 30 per cent on millions  of acres”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 64)

[^5]:“Mutations, in particular those induced by X-ray, were widely studied and used. At the same time the struggle was begun against lethal and harmful mutations and hereditary diseases, which could be revealed and anticipated only by genetical methods. This enumeration could be continued at length.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 43)
