 [^1]:“Prezent’s slanderous attack on Raikov was not an exception.  In those years, Prezent had already developed his special style of scientific-political demagoguery” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 10)
 
 [^2]:“One  could cite many such examples of Prezent’s “class vigilance.”  Indeed, two to three years later, it was these tactics that Prezent brought into the movement headed by [[Lysenko]]”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 11)
 
 [^3]:“In 1935-1936, however, [[Lysenko]] and Prezent announced  a new concept of heredity in opposition to the generally  accepted chromosome theory which they denounced as reactionary, idealist, metaphysical, and barren”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 20)

 [^5]:“the beginning of 1939 the [[Lysenko]]-edited journal Yarovizatsiya published Prezent’s article “On pseudoscientific  theories in genetics,” in which he attempted to draw a farfetched, slanderous parallel between the work of [[Vavilov]] and  the absurd ideas of the reactionary and anti-Marxist philosopher, Diihring:”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 54)

 [^7]:“the party organization considers essential for  the purposes of reconstruction of the institute the dismissal  of [[Vavilov]] as director, since, as the ideologist of formal genet¬  ics in the U.S.S.R., by remaining at his post he aids the activization and consolidation of anti-Darwinians throughout  the Soviet Union, thereby interfering with the rapid rebuild¬  ing of the experimental and plant-breeding network of the  Union along Darwinist lines.””  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 56)
