He was known for political demogogory[^1] that he applied to the Lysenkoism movement.[^2] With Lysenko he announced a genetic theory that went against the prevalent Chromosome theory at the time.[^3] Heavily criticized Vavilov.[^4] One slanderous article from the Lysenko-editd journal Yarovizatsiya titled ""On pseudoscientific  theories in genetics"[^5] with the following quote attaking Vavilov, “But who does not know that the literature denies the scientific significance of Marxist-Leninist materialistic dialectics and the materialistic theory of development?23”[^6] In the same article he wanted Vavilov dismissed for anti-Darwinism[^7]
