- Brought in 150,000 plant varieties from the world[^11]
- The AIPB was said to do great work[^12]

#### General
- Went contrary to [[Lysenko]] but viewed his phasic development of plants and summer planting of potatoes favorbly.[^2] 
- Muller came to the U.S.S.R as a socialist sympathizers and friend[^3]
- In response to [[Lysenko]] about him not citing enough marx but instead Darwin he retorted[^4] That Marx held Darwin in High regard.
- Was student of Pryanishnikov[^13]
- Arrested at an alarming rate[^5] and soon after his collaborators[^6]
	- Arrested due to: spying for England; leadership of the  Labor Peasant Party; sabotage in agriculture; links with white emigres; etc.[^7]
	- While arrested was elected to the royal society of London.[^8]
	- Case was recalled for study but he died.[^9]



Footnotes:

[^1]:Besides demanding that the ten to twelve years required to develop cereal varieties for different regions be reduced to four years (by using hothouses),((Medvedev and Lerner, p. 19)“But it served as a base for subsequent criticisms of AIPB, and of Vavilov as being incapable   of solving the problem”   (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 19)

[^2]:“The opposite side in the polemic was represented in 1936 by the majority of leaders of the genetical, cytological, and breeding institutes of our country.1 Vavilov, at that time the world’s outstanding plant breeder, applied geneticist, and geographer, enjoying merited recognition and fame in many countries, was the factual head of the opposition to [[Lysenko]]’s genetical ideas. It should be noted, however, that Vavilov and the other scientists took a favorable view of certain other ideas then being worked out by [[Lysenko]] and his institute (for example, phasic development of plants, and summer planting of potatoes).2” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 21)

[^3]:“Muller, an American scientist and friend of Vavilov, came to work in the U.S.S.R. as a socialist sympathizer.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 33)
[^4]:“Why do you speak of Darwin, and why do you not choose examples from Marx and Engels? vavilov: Darwin worked on evolution of species earlier. Engels and Marx held Darwin in high regard. Darwin is not all, but he is the greatest biologist, who proved the evolution of organisms.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 60)

[^5]:“In the evening the other members of the expedition returned without Vavilov. He was taken so fast that his things  were left in one of the cars.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 70)

[^6]:“After Vavilov, his closest collaborators and friends were also arrested and later perished in prison”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 70)

[^7]:“Vavilov. He was found guilty on a number of points of Article 58: Belonging to a rightist conspiracy; spying for England; leadership of the Labor Peasant Party; sabotage in agriculture; links with white emigres; etc.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 72)

[^8]:“At the end of 1942, Vavilov, who had mysteriously “disappeared” from the world science scene, was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 74)

[^9]:“Vavilov file was urgently recalled for study. But it was too late. Life was slowly ebbing from a body exhausted by malnutrition”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 74)

[^10]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 19) The procumation was unrealistic and served to help the attack against Vavilov

[^11]:“Their members investigated the agriculture and plant resources of 65 countries and brought to the Soviet Union over 150,000 plant varieties, forms and species—all of the plant-breeding wealth created by mankind in its centuries-  old history. Thus the collection of the world’s domesticated plants was established.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 40)

[^12]:“In working on the collection the  institute gave the country hundreds of literary monographs and  systematic botanical descriptions instead of new varieties for widespread production.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 53)

[^13]:“Vavilov, whose fate has already been recounted, was a  student of Pryanishnikov’s, and they were very fond of each  other” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 95)
