[^1]:Besides demanding that the ten to twelve years required to develop cereal varieties for different regions be reduced to four years (by using hothouses),((Medvedev and Lerner, p. 19)
“But it served as a base for subsequent criticisms of AIPB, and of Vavilov as being incapable   of solving the problem”   (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 19)

[^2]:“The opposite side in the polemic was represented in 1936 by the majority of leaders of the genetical, cytological, and breeding institutes of our country.1 Vavilov, at that time the world’s outstanding plant breeder, applied geneticist, and geographer, enjoying meritedrecognition and fame in many coun¬  
tries, was the factual head of the opposition to Lysenko’s  
genetical ideas. It should be noted, however, that Vavilov  
and the other scientists took a favorable view of certain other  
ideas then being worked out by Lysenko and his institute (for  
example, phasic development of plants, and summer planting  
of potatoes).2”
