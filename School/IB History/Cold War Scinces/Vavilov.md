[^2]:“The opposite side in the polemic was represented in 1936 by the majority of leaders of the genetical, cytological, and breeding institutes of our country.1 Vavilov, at that time the world’s outstanding plant breeder, applied geneticist, and geographer, enjoying merited recognition and fame in many countries, was the factual head of the opposition to Lysenko’s genetical ideas. It should be noted, however, that Vavilov and the other scientists took a favorable view of certain other ideas then being worked out by Lysenko and his institute (for example, phasic development of plants, and summer planting of potatoes).2” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 21)

[^4]:“Why do you speak of Darwin, and why do you not choose  
examples from Marx and Engels?  
vavilov: Darwin worked on evolution of species earlier. Engels  
and Marx held Darwin in high regard. Darwin is not all, but he  
is the greatest biologist, who proved the evolution of organisms.”
