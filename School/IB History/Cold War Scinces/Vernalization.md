 - Was met in opposition for widespread use[^1]
	 - Due to it being burdensome and risky with special sheds[^2]
	 - Data suggested negative to no effect[^3]
 #### Lysenko experiments
  - Involved reversible transitions in spring and winter forms of wheat[^4]
  - Most prolonged experiment was winter wheat Kooperatorka[^5]
	  - “But the pot with these plants sown on March 3 was left not in a warm hothouse but in a cool one where the temperature from March 3 to the end of April was frequently no higher than 10-15° C. Only beginning with May was the temperature higher and, most importantly, never below 15° C. Since the Lutescens 329 variety was more of a winter type than Kooperatorka, both its plants lived until late fall and perished without heading” [^6] 
	  - Did not have replication[^7]
	  - Lysenko resoned if he can alter one wheat into another than there are no genes[^8]
	  - Lysenko thought this proved that during a brief time you could alter the hereditary nature of the plant[^9]

[^1]:“Yet the widespread use of vernalization did meet some opposition among scientists and collective  farmers”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)

[^2]:“However, treatment of tens of thousands of tons of seed on each collective or state farm was a burdensome and risky  procedure, requiring special sheds and great expenditure of  work forces.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 16)

[^3]:“According to experimental data, in the absence  of drought in late summer, vernalization lowered the yield.  Some varieties of wheat failed to respond to the treatment  altogether”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 16)

[^4]:“In later years Lysenko reported other analogous experiments. The question of reversible transformation of winter and spring forms will be examined later in greater detail. Here, it is the initial “historical” experiment from which the repudiation of classical genetics started that is of interest.)” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 23)

[^5]:“Our most prolonged experiments at this time are those transforming the winter wheat Kooperatorka into a spring form” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 23)

[^6]:(Medvedev and Lerner, p. 24)

[^7]:“An experiment without replicatioti is not a scientific experiment. The single seed could have been a hybrid, a mutant, or a contaminant.” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 25)

[^8]:“Lysenko considered that, if he could alter a winter into a spring form and then reverse the process, there are no immutable genes for winter habit, and all depends on the environment: hence there are no genes of any kind. But this  analysis lacks logic” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 25)

[^9]:“Lysenko, with his Kooperatorka experiments, has  shown that, if one approaches a plant skillfully, knowing life and not merely the external traits of a plant, if one chooses methods of influence not as the geneticists do, “the stronger, the better,”” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 31)“but selects methods consonant with the given stage of development of the organism, then in a brief period it is possible to alter the hereditary nature of the plant” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 32)
