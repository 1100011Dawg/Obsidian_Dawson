 - Was met in opposition for widespread use[^1]
	 - Due to it being burdensome and risky with special sheds[^2]
	 - Data suggested negative to no effect[^3]
 #### Lysenko experiments
  - Involved reversible transitions in spring and winter forms of wheat[^4]
  - Most prolonged experiment was [^5]


[^1]:“Yet the widespread use of vernalization did meet some opposition among scientists and collective  farmers”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 15)

[^2]:“However, treatment of tens of thousands of tons of seed on each collective or state farm was a burdensome and risky  procedure, requiring special sheds and great expenditure of  work forces.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 16)

[^3]:“According to experimental data, in the absence  of drought in late summer, vernalization lowered the yield.  Some varieties of wheat failed to respond to the treatment  altogether”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 16)

[^4]:“In later years Lysenko reported other analogous experiments. The question of reversible transformation of winter and spring forms will be examined later in greater detail. Here, it is the initial “historical” experiment from which the repudiation of classical genetics started that is of interest.)” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 23)

[^5]:“Our most prolonged experiments at this time are those transforming the winter wheat Kooperatorka into a spring form” (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 23)
