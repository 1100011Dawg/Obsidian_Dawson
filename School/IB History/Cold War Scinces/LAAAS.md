Footnotes:
[^1]:The famous august, 1948, session of the LAAAS  was for a long time sorrowfully designated the historical one.  It did, indeed, become an event never to be forgotten in the  history of science and mankind”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 103)

[^2]:“Immediately after the session, hundreds of scientists, the  best and most qualified representatives of Soviet biology, were  either dismissed or demoted on the basis of fabricated,  slanderous, and perverted accusations of idealism, reactionary  views, Morganism, Weismannism, complicity with imperialism  and the bourgeoisie, Mendelism, anti-Michurinism, groveling  before the West, sabotage, metaphysics, mechanism, racism,  cosmopolitanism, formalism, unproductiveness, anti-Marxism,  anti-Darwinism, alienation from practice, and the like”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 103)

[^3]:“they  did not always, and in everything, agree with the ideas and  hypotheses advanced by [[Lysenko]], [[Prezent]], Glushchenko,  Ol’shansky, Stoletov, and other members of that group.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 103)

[^4]:“At the end of 1948, Muller, having previously been elected  a foreign member of the AS, announced his resignation from  the Academy as a protest against the persecution of Soviet  geneticists which followed the LAAAS session in August of  the same year”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 34)

[^5]:“The letter’s prognosis of a successful Congress in 1938 was  not fulfilled, for by then Meister, Levit, and Gorbunov, all  members of the organizing committee, as well as its president,  Muralov, had been arrested. [[Lysenko]] became president of the  LAAAS.13”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 52)

[^6]:“[[Lysenko]] and his groups thus fell upon hard times. In the  spring of 1948, Zhdanov raised the question of strengthening  the leadership of LAAAS, which assumed [[Lysenko]]’s dismissal  as president.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 113)

[^7]:“No elections  were held for the next twelve years. [[Lysenko]] deliberately  kept the vacancies open: he awaited an increase in the ranks  of his supporters.”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 116)

[^8]:“But even this decree was not implemented. There were no  elections until 1956, when [[Lysenko]] left the post of president,  and then they were conducted by open balloting”  (Medvedev and Lerner, p. 116)
