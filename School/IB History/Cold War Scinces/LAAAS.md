#### August 1948 session
 - Was an important event[^1] where hundreds of scientists were either dismissed on slanderous accusations of Morgainsm, Weismannism, imperialism, Mendelism, and more.[^2] This was because they disagreed with the ideas of Lysenko, Prezent, and Glushchenko.[^3]
#### 1937 election
 - Prezent highlighted [[Kol'tsov]]'s "eugenical work" in order to hinder his chance in the AS election against Lysenko.
