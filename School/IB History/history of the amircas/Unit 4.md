**Question: “The civil rights of indigenous peoples in the Americas improved after 1945.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?**
Explain what the question is asking (define any terms/ideas here):
 - The qeustion is asking about the general right of indigenous americans after 1945. the demoraction of time period allows there to be more contetion with the answer due to previous undenible reailty of maltreatement before that.
One word/sentence answer to the question:
 - yes 
Set context / give background:
 - Though in the United States the indigenous people of that lands right took a turn for the worse, the general improvemnt in canada and other American countries make up for this. For example in canda the red paper was estabilised in 1970, the affected the suposed patriation of the Canadian constitution. and in 1992 there was an amendmentestablsied o show that mexico is a multicultural society. This is addtionally in contrast to direct violent action against the indiegeinous population such as ~~wounded knee~~ and slavery. 
**Write out claims you would use to address this question followed by a list of concrete evidence you can use to address the question**:
 - the claims would be semi reptinous, with one being the situation of indigenous poeple in canda marketbly imprved, the next one would be the siutation in mexico improved, then the situation in latin america marketbly imprvoed with acts such as aim. The evidence for each will be first canda: succsfully patrialte express, 1960 right to vote 1951 land claim commition, mexio: add ademntment to constitution , human right more prsent 1970 more powerfull ngo, and for latin america laws that allowed right for indignous poeple to vote even though they cant read spanish, the situation in 1992 K'iche Maya, Evo Morales became the first Amymará to be elected presedenct.

**In what ways, and for what reasons, did women’s role in society change after 1945? Support your answer with three specific examples from one or more countries.**

    I would say the main reson women's role in society shifted after 1945 was industrilization, though this was catalized by the war effort. Industrilization removed time consuming activites such as laundry, dish cleaning and speed up others. This in combination with the war effort had Women go into buisness due to the economic insentives. It mainly begain with lower class women but soon envolped most women, leading to a double work day. One important facotr in this was the Feminine Mystique, that " radiclized" women in order to pursue womens rights. some of these agendas incluce child care, maternity leaves, and alliviation of the double day of work. This was most blatant in america, becase Canda's groups weren't as militerized, but in Latin America the authortarian nature had these groups more subduied. The work force was one of the main changes in women's role in socity, but an addtiional role change was that in politics. With many women sufferage movments taking palce before 1945 they had time to deveolp a political backing behind there demand. this backing included groups such as NOW contributing to women shaping their new role in society.
