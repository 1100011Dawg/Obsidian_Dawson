#### Pricing
 - Price: the money customers pay for a service
 - **Cost-plus pricing**:
	 - adding mark-up to the average cost of producing a product
	 - $SellingPrice = Average cost+Markup price$
	 - $MarkupPrice = \%\#*Average cost$
	 - Best used by retail/grocery stores(Costco)
	 - Don't use hig price fluctuations
-   **Penetration**: 
	- Prcing used to gain market share.(ex epic games)
	- Creates market share and brand loyalty, and drives out compitition

	- Best used with little product differation and price-elastic
-   **Skimming**:
