#### Turtles all the way down
 - They live on the top layers of an infinite stack of turtles, with mutiple turtles residing upon one turtle. In this there is a danger to being stomped on if they are one the second highest turtle layer, thus divoners use their sence to see if there is a chance of danger
 - turtles can give birth and die, if they give birth it is called a rumbling, if they die it is called a tumbling. fo rubling the top layer only produce minor earthquakes around once every 10 years, the socond top produces more servere earth quates every 100 years, with the 10000 year ones almost always wiping out most of civilizion, with the tumbling equivlant always being worse.
 - The middle of the second layer turtle(contenant size) is where most first layer turtles reside(state size) due to it being less arched, though there is more people being stepped on here, the outer edges do contain turtles and more permenant civiliations, though it is all more tilted. In this status on the outer edges is repersented by how tilted your house is, with perfelctly flat big houses only beloning to the upper class, with poor people not having enough money for that large of a foundation.  
 - Some turtles have died and there shells have split somehow(mabye giant birds using rocks?) in the centor allowing for great oceans, with poeple either at the edges or just floating. 
 - persons/unique features per class
	 - legend of great barbarian who held up a turtles foot, some claim to be desended from him, 20th level can hold up the foot (but at great cost, either death ofr something really close)
	 - Divinors determin if the current land might be stepped on
	 - druids can communicate witht he turtles at a high enough level(same for rangers though less so)
	 - charectors with shields can join a few cults around the turtle
	 - warlock can shoose a turtle as his god
- rumors of the land up north, a once rich grass land now being run to to the shell of the turtle, rumors of also robotic humans and animals,(and perhaps robitic turtles)(basically a highly advanced land reviving a dead shell.)
- a lot of shells roll if if they are not in the center and they are dead
- tortles are either highly regared o out casts(depends on cultures veiw of turtles). some believe the turltes tumblings and rumblings are the cause of all there problems and seek to destory them, other praise the turtles as a
